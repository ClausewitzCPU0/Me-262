1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,660
1944年中期 
By the middle of 1944

2
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,800
盟军投入1000架轰炸机
Allied forces were regularly flying raids of 1,000 bombers over Nazi Germany,

3
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,410
在P51野马等远航程战斗机护航下对纳粹德国定期轰炸
Escorted by powerful, long range sightings like the P51 Mustang

4
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:38,850
德国空军无力抵抗这庞大的空中舰队
the German Luftwaffe could put up little resistance to these vast air armadas 

5
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,820
但是在1944年7月
But in July 1944

6
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:46,170
一种新式德国战斗机出现在天空中
a new German fighter appeared in the skies,

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,250
其飞行时速比野马高出100多英里
capable of flying over one hundred miles per hour faster than the Mustang,

8
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,980
并且装备了4门30mm口径的机炮
and armed with four thirty millimeter cannons.

9
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:57,000
可以摆脱护航战斗机并一次性将轰炸机全部摧毁
It could outmaneuver the escorts and destroy a bomber in a single pass. 

10
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,180
德军的新战机
The new German fighter,

11
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:05,400
这种让盟军飞行员恐惧，并且让德国空军认为自己不可战胜的
which put fear into the allied pilots and made the German Luftwaffe feeling invincible.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,540
正是喷气式的梅塞施密特262
Was the jet propelled Messerschmitt 262

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,380
我第一次看见德国的喷气机Me262时，
The first time I saw a German jet, the Me262

14
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,370
我简直不敢相信它跑得这么快
I could hardly believe it how fast it was.

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:18,740
*听不清


16
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,700
这次我们不再是猎物，而是猎人
At this time we were again not the hunted,but the hunters.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,380
*所以我们现在有信心取胜
So now we won with a ego.

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,160
使用出色的影像档案和*色彩再现，
Using extraordinary archive film and color re-enactments,

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,570
《Battle Stations》节目将会深入速度之争，探索航空史上第一种投入实战的喷气战斗机
Battle stations dives into the high speed world of the race to get the first jet fighter ever to fly in combat.

20
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,240
梅塞施密特262 : 喷气竞赛
Messerschmitt 262：RACE FOR THE JET

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,380
讽刺的是，令盟军恐惧的Me262的起源是一张和平条约
Ironically, the origins of the fearsome Messerschmitt 262 were born out of a peace treaty.

22
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,450
在一战战败后
Following its defeat in World War One,

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,020
德国被同盟国强制签署禁止发展常规飞行技术的协定，
Germany was forced by the allies to sign an agreement which banned them from developing further conventional aircraft technologies,

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,540
然而其中并未提及火箭和喷气推进技术。
that rockets and jet propulsion would never mentioned.

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,400
1930年，
in the 1930s

26
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:12,150
元首开始描绘纳粹德国的蓝图
Adolf Hitler began to build his vision for Nazi Germany.

27
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,630
其中包括世界最强的空军
That vision included the most powerful air force in the world.

28
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,480
为达到这一目标，空军必须有高航速
To achieve this, the airforce must have speed.

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,280
当时，
At that time,

30
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,310
人们认识到，飞得更快意味着需要飞的更高
It was realized that to fly faster meant flying higher,

31
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,900
因为高处空气更稀薄
where the air is thinner.

32
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,730
但当飞行高度增加，
but the higher a plane flies,

33
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:32,490
螺旋桨就更难牵引飞机前进
the harder it is for a propeller to draw it through the air.

34
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,850
在德国哥廷根大学，一位年轻的工程师 汉斯·冯·奥海恩开始了涡轮喷气引擎的研究
At the German University of Göttingen a young engineer named Hans von Ohain began development work on a turbo jet engine.

35
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,460
汉斯·冯·奥海恩是个十分优秀的学生，
他第一次完成喷气引擎的构想时仅有21岁
A brilliant student Hans von Ohain was only twenty one years old when he first conceived the idea of a jet engine.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,590
There's one.

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,570
他是个好学的技术人员
He was a technician with an inquisitive mind.

38
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:03,180
他非常擅长解决理论问题
He was very good at theoretical problems,

39
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,560
而且他也在学习物理
and he studied physics as well.

40
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,370
If you tried it.

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,210
受到他教授的鼓舞，
Encouraged by his professor,

42
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,880
这位年轻工程师开始着手制造原型
the young engineer began to build a working prototype.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,270
此时的英国，
Meanwhile, in Britain,

44
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:21,300
全然不知德国发生的事，26岁的皇家空军飞行员弗兰克·惠特尔
totally unaware of what was happening in Germany,a 26 year old Royal Air Force pilots named Frank Whittle,

45
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,030
正在研发一种燃气涡轮引擎
was developing a gas turbine engine.

46
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,050
1932年
in 1932

47
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,660
他提交了世界上第一份喷气引擎的专利
He filed a patent on the world's first jet engine.

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,960
在这个早期片段中
In this early film,

49
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,440
弗兰克·惠特尔亲自解释了引擎的原理
Frank Whittle himself explains the principles of his engine.

50
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,420
这代表一个离心压缩机
This represents a centrifugal type compressor.

51
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:45,210
用这个在前端吸入空气，像这样压缩进入燃烧室
I use this to pull in air at the front and to compress it into combustion chambers like this,

52
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:53,100
这里会注入燃料并燃烧，使空气膨胀，让它有足够的能量驱动压缩机的涡轮
where the injection of burning the fuel ** and expand the air and gives it enough energy to drive a turbine which drives the compressor.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
这个设计将会成为世界上第一个完全可行的喷气引擎
This design was to become the world's first fully working jet engine.

54
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,280
但惠特尔发现很难让英国军方重视他的设计
But Whittle found it difficult to get his design taken seriously by the British military establishment.

55
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,400
当时科学家，即当权者的建议是这个设计不可行
The scientific advice at that time and i.e by the people in power was it couldn't work.

56
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,860
让它正常工作需要过多的能量
It required just too much power to make it work.

57
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:17,010
军方人员听取了这个建议
And the officials at the ministry listened to that advice,

58
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:27,210
*惠特尔被视作妄想用当时无法实现的想法一举成名的人
and Whittle was very much seen as a bit of an upstart that was trying to sort of make his name and push forward an idea that was not really achievable at that time. 

59
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:32,910
对惠特尔的阻碍导致的延期，之后将成为德国喷气引擎研究的显著优势
The delays, which were to hamper Whittle were to prove a distinct advantage for German jet engine development.

60
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,540
1935年
By 1935

61
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:45,330
汉斯在导师建议下，通过飞机制造商亨克尔的经济支持完成了测试引擎
Hans von Ohain had developed a test engine on the advice of his professor approach the aircraft manufacturer Ernst Hanckel for financial support.

62
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,200
亨克尔作为激进理念的赞助者而出名
Hanckel was known as a patron of radical concepts,

63
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:54,840
他特别看重那些能提高速度，让他能建造世界最快飞机的技术
especially those which would lead to higher speeds and enable him to build the fastest airplane in the world.

64
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,540
亨克尔对此印象深刻
他意识到这种引擎的巨大潜力，要求制造全尺寸型号
 Impressed, Heinkel recognize the enormous potential of such an engine and ordered the construction of a fullscale *power plant.

65
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,990
汉斯和他的工程师团队接受了任务，
开始研发亨克尔HeS 3引擎
Ohain and his team of engineers accepted the task and set to work on what would become the HES 3 jet engine.

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
回到英国，
Back in Britain,

67
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:21,900
惠特尔终于筹到了开一间小公司的钱
Whittle had finally managed to raise enough funds to establish a small company.

68
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,270
公司建立在莱斯特郡的拉特沃思小镇
Located in the little Leicestershire town of Lutterworth,

69
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:29,100
他将其命名为Power Jets
he called it powered jets.

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,950
1937年
In 1937,

71
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,750
他第一次测试引擎
he tested his engine for the first time.

72
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:44,430
惠特尔遇到了各种问题*
Whittle had all sorts of problems when the engine on pairing up ran away with itself and just kept going and going the thrust built up,

73
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:49,020
惠特尔就站在那看着机器爆炸，因为他已经被吓坏了
and Whittle just stood there and waited for it to go bang because he was just transfixed by it.

74
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,300
但同时他也被这个情景所吸引
He also was enthralled by what was happening.

75
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,710
这台机器是他的孩子
This was his baby,

76
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:54,750
惠特尔不想让它破裂
and he didn't want it to break fall apart.

77
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:55,830
他正在悉心照顾这台机器
He was looking after it.

78
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:58,710
即便其他所有人都明智地立马跑路了
Although everyone else sensibly left the area very quickly.

79
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,990
尽管有许多挫折与失败
Despite many setbacks and failures,

80
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:13,470
惠特尼最终掌控了他的引擎
which will finally succeeded in controlling his engine.

81
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,900
但是英国政府仍未被说服
but the British government was still not convinced,

82
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,200
政府更倾向传统的飞机和引擎设计
preferring instead conventional designs for aircraft and engines.

83
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,440
惠特尔的发明在整个30年代面临重重阻力
Whittle face resistance to his invention throughout the 1930s.

84
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:30,540
先前的喷气推进测试表明涡桨飞机将会很重，
Previous experiments with jet propulsion indicated that turboprops will be heavy,

85
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,690
昂贵且不可靠
expensive and very unreliable.

86
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:37,380
英国航空部和皇家空军认为
The British Air Ministry and the Royal aircraft establishment saw,

87
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:44,550
喷气推进要想成为飞机动力的可行替代方案，至少还有10至15年的路要走
that turbo jets were not going to be a viable alternative for Aero propulsion until ten or fifteen years down the road.

88
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,220
与此同时
Throughout this time,

89
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:51,090
惠特尔并不知道德国人也在研发喷气引擎
Frank Whittle did not know that the Germans were developing a jet engine.

90
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,970
项目的保密非常完善
So good was the secrecy surrounding the project.

91
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:58,230
研发内容从不为人所知
Little was known about what was being developed at all 

92
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:05,250
当时，惠特尔35年的专利被发布在德国的技术杂志上
Whittle's patents, which were released in 35 and were published in Germany in German in the technical magazines at that time,

93
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,830
汉斯得知了这一切
made available to * von Ohain,

94
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:12,120
惠特尔已经注册了很多专利
a lot of material Whittle it previously had as a patent,

95
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:16,860
可以这么说，汉斯已经在阅读这些内容
and now I think it would be fair to say at that time that von Ohain would have gone down the road of reading these,

96
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:17,940
他不会抄袭
he wouldn't have copied it,

97
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,390
但他一定会阅读并且运用到他自己的领域中
but he would certainly have read it and interpreted it into the zones he was involved in.

98
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,490
当战争阴云开始笼罩
As the clouds of war gathered on the horizon,

99
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,120
纳粹政权对开发高速的推进技术更为执着
the Nazi regime had become more determined than ever to develop faster forms of propulsion for its *lift off.

100
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,610
1938年
in 1938,

101
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:42,960
帝国航空部签发了德国航空工业规范
the Reich Air Ministry issued a specification to the German aviation industry.

102
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,230
一种单座喷气战斗机
A single seat turbo jet fighter.

103
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,250
被这道命令所推动
Spurred on by this directive,

104
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,110
亨克尔的团队推行这项计划
Heinkel's team pushed ahead,

105
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:55,380
设计一型装备奥海恩引擎的战机
designing an aircraft to be powered by Ohain's jet engines.

106
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,660
得益于绘图板上的两兄弟
From the drawing boards of twin brothers, Siegfried and Walter Gunter,

107
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:04,410
第一款实用型喷气动力飞机即将起飞
the first practical jet powered aircraft was to take flight.

108
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:06,840
命名为He-178
It was called the He-178.

109
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,020
1939年8月27日
On August the 27th 1939

110
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,960
在二战爆发前一周
one week before the outbreak of World War II,

111
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,510
小巧的He-178升空
the little Heinkel 178 took to the air.

112
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,780
德国人在喷气引擎竞赛中先行一步
The Germans had succeeded in being first in getting a jet air war.

113
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,830
但第一架喷气战斗机的竞赛才刚刚开始
But the race for the first jet fighter had only just begun.

114
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,840
1939年9月3日
On September the 3rd 1939,

115
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,120
二战开始
the Second World War began,

116
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,290
在接下来的几周时间里
and over the next few weeks,

117
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,200
德国人扫清了他们面前的一切
Germany swept all before them.

118
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,980
亨克尔和汉斯对喷气飞机的世界首飞兴奋不已，
Flushed with the success of having just flown the world's first jet aircraft,

119
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:59,560
*两个月后，他们可以向纳粹政府展示飞机了
It was two months before Ernst Heinkel and Hans von Ohain were able to demonstrate their plane to the Nazi government.

120
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,100
但随着纳粹军队所向披靡，传统空军主宰天空
But with its army conquering all and with its conventional airforce becoming masters of the skies,

121
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,920
德国人突然对喷气动力失去了兴趣
the Germans had suddenly lost interest in jet power.

122
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,850
He-178短暂而荣耀的一生结束，余生注定在柏林博物馆度过
The He-178 short but glorious life was over and was destined to spend the rest of his days in a Berlin museum.

123
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:31,300
但有坚定信念的人仍在默默地完善他自己的喷气飞机设计
But there were others in Germany who did not believe that the race for the first jet fighter was over quietly working on his own jet aircraft design.

124
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
这就是后来的Me-262
that would become the Me-262

125
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,300
设计者是杰出的41岁航空工程师：威利·梅塞施密特
was a brilliant 41 year old aeronautical engineer called Wilhelm Messerschmitt.

126
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,970
整个三十年代，梅塞施密特都是战斗机和轰炸机设计者和制造商
Throughout the thirties Messerschmitt had been a designer and manufacturer of bombers and fighters,

127
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:47,250
a favorite with the Nazi hierarchy,

128
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:55,050
it was a workaholic and created loyalty from all that knew him ever since he was very artistic at home.

129
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:56,820
Over the course of a weekend,

130
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:00,750
he could design an aircraft part on an eighth or sheet of paper,

131
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,350
and then the drawing would be ready to be taken into the workshop right away.

132
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:12,240
This consideration of his designs were that he was a very intuitive person,

133
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:18,420
but he would lose his temper a lot so many Cubans to wait.

134
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:23,940
Yet whilst the German authorities appeared to have lost interest in their jet industry in Britain,

135
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:26,760
Frank Whittles fortunes have changed.

136
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,860
After a long and frustrating battle,

137
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:34,530
the British Air Ministry finally agreed to finance and build a factory for him to manufacture his jet engine.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,320
The Gloucester Aircraft Company was given the contract to produce an experimental plane that would prove whittles engines.

139
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:45,030
It was called the two thousand and eight.

140
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,310
The?

141
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,480
Finance are made of one thousand nine thousand one thousand,

142
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:51,960
nine hundred and ninety,

143
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,060
nine and twenty months after hands,

144
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,630
one of the Heinz one thousand eight hundred and seven eight had first flown at last.

145
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:57,810
He,

146
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:59,490
two thousand and eight took to the air.

147
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,280
The first flight of the two thousand and eight was a significant event,

148
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:10,500
because obviously this was the final proof of the aircraft's operational use.

149
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,520
Whittle overnight became the success he had achieved,

150
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:25,200
something that previously people for it wouldn't happen an aircraft from an archipelago and they would suddenly have an income gratulation well done,

151
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:25,590
you know,

152
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:28,230
in Frankfurt or Turnround said while it was bloody well designed to fly.

153
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,570
Amongst all this excitement was visiting American Army Chief of Staff General Henry Hap Arnold.

154
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:41,880
He was convinced that this British invention could help to spring board America into the race for the jet.

155
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:50,100
It was very surprised about the fact that the British had a jet engined aircraft flying,

156
00:11:50,101 --> 00:12:01,590
and he can only speculate that the Germans were at least as far in their development of a jet aircraft as well so enthusiastic about the new jet technology and wanted to emphasize the?

157
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:01,770
U.

158
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,540
S need to catch up.

159
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,110
Arnold,

160
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:08,730
negotiated with the British government to bring an example of Whittle's engine to the United States,

161
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,400
said the American Turbojet programme could begin.

162
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,170
Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill was also eager to get the?

163
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:16,350
U.

164
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:20,910
S committed to the British war effort and agreed to hand over whittles jet designs.

165
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:29,670
Churchill's attitude was how can we involve America in our fight against the dictatorships?

166
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:41,430
And he's seen the the fact that we would give this this very latest development of technology to the Americans freely would help them appreciate this sort of problems we were in and later on.

167
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:42,900
maybe come down on our side.

168
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,270
Hastily arrangements were made to box up whittles engine parts and plans.

169
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,600
Amidst top secrecy,

170
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:55,410
this precious cargo was loaded into a bummer and flown to a bowling field.

171
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:56,070
In Washington,

172
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:56,640
DC.

173
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,310
It was then transported to the General Electric plant in Massachusetts.

174
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,840
Lynch.

175
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,120
Unlike the small scale of development that will face in Great Britain,

176
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:17,760
the American effort in modifying and improving his engine,

177
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,350
United States was on a large scale.

178
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,020
At the General Electric plant,

179
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:31,440
the company used its experience in heat resists in a high street alloys to modify and improve what would eventually become the general electric ion engines.

180
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:34,740
I cannot overemphasize the secrecy and the importance of this work.

181
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,300
We know that both the Italians and the Germans are working on jets.

182
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,370
I hardly need to tell you that they must not win the race.

183
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,780
Given unlimited priority,

184
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:52,560
we will have the first unit running on task in six months.

185
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,110
Meanwhile,

186
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:56,160
in Germany,

187
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,710
despite Nazi indifference to the jet,

188
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:01,530
ankles team continued to develop a jet fighter.

189
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,480
On March,

190
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:04,350
the thirtieth one thousand,

191
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:05,580
nine hundred and eighty one,

192
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:06,750
the hanckel tomato,

193
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:08,070
had its first test flight.

194
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,620
Triumphantly hands on her hind was amongst those who reveled in this momentous occasion.

195
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,440
Howard by his jet,

196
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:22,110
the plane was a superb design capable of speeds in excess of five hundred miles per hour.

197
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,840
It was light years ahead of all its competitors.

198
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,300
The test flight was a huge personal success for Hanckel and von Hohenheim,

199
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:34,050
but sadly there jet fighter was not destined to be a winner.

200
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,770
At the core of his uncle's problem with getting contracts for operational jet and rocket aircraft was his inability to play by the rules the Russian Air Ministry.

201
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:45,000
but on the other hand,

202
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:48,930
measurement was able to play by the rules and was awarded with substantial contracts.

203
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,570
As one thousand,

204
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:54,090
nine hundred and eighty one drew to a close Britain,

205
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:57,690
America and Germany were all committed to jet development.

206
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:01,380
But for America another event made the race more intense.

207
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,860
On December seven,

208
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:05,190
one nine thousand,

209
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:06,240
nine hundred and eighty one,

210
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,040
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.

211
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,780
America's entry into World War II brought a much needed lifeline to the allies in the battle against Germany.

212
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,910
The full blown rates for the first jet fighter was now on.

213
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,280
In Britain,

214
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:28,170
the government had finally given the go ahead for Frank to develop a jet engine for a fighter.

215
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,900
In America,

216
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:33,870
General Electric was pulling out all the stops.

217
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:37,440
Their promise to produce an engine within six months was on target.

218
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,660
And in Germany,

219
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:47,850
Hitler now saw the enemy to six to as a wonder weapon and pushed measurement for an early completion to get the plane into production.

220
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:52,890
Do you wonder why they wanted us to get a move on and granted permission to any of her nourishment?

221
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:54,150
Proposal is before we run.

222
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,030
The German jet aircraft industry was now moving forward at full speed.

223
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:03,000
Research and innovation was everywhere.

224
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:08,070
Designers and engineers came up with concepts that were years in advance of their time.

225
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:15,540
Wind tunnel tests into sweat wings and fuselage configurations enable the German planemakers to be way ahead of the allies.

226
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:26,760
It was a mixture of calculations and calculate this in that and comparisons and was carrying out tells us until you got the feelings,

227
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:28,140
this was it,

228
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:31,440
and then he rebuilt it and tried it and measured it,

229
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:32,580
and it was fun.

230
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,130
On July,

231
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,090
the eighteenth one thousand,

232
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:40,410
nine hundred and ninety two,

233
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,720
the Emmy to six to made its debt.

234
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,920
At the first flight of the day was not without its own.

235
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,150
We haven't really.

236
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:56,370
We ran into difficulties when the plane's tail would not lift up,

237
00:16:56,371 --> 00:17:02,580
so we ran tests and discovered that if the pilot brakes gently at speed,

238
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:03,510
then to tail,

239
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:06,090
when would it lift items that give you and no one else?

240
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,450
It worked when the aircraft reached a one hundred and twenty miles per hour.

241
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:14,280
The pilots touched the brakes,

242
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:15,450
the nose dropped,

243
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,900
the tale came up and the Emmy to six too,

244
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:19,620
took to the air.

245
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,650
The performance of the enemy to six to win its test flight was incredible.

246
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:37,170
On its second fly to climb to eleven thousand five hundred feet and reach the speed of four hundred and fifty miles per hour.

247
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:37,680
already,

248
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,530
it was faster than any allied planes in existence.

249
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,570
Soon,

250
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:46,590
German pilots would be flying at speeds that others could only have dreamt up.

251
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,640
That would the Emmy to six to be the answer to Hitler's dreams.

252
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,590
The Emmy to six tubes jet engines could now thrust it at speeds of over five hundred and fifty miles per hour.

253
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,020
It could simply outfly anything in the sky.

254
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,770
Armed with four thirty millimeter cannons,

255
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:11,610
each was capable of delivering over eighty explosive shells into the enemy.

256
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,070
Future plans were also to include twenty four wings slung air to air rocket.

257
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,190
Nicknamed the Swallow,

258
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:26,100
this awesome machine heralded the dawning of a new age of battle and for Hitler's lift buffer.

259
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:29,700
It was hoped that when it finally met the allied forces,

260
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,350
it's hell would be unleashed.

261
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:45,060
The successful test flight of the German Emmy to six too had at last proved to the left of alpha generals.

262
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:48,240
This was the fighting machine that could win the war,

263
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:53,730
but a lot of development work was still needed before it could become the old conquering answer to Nazi dreams.

264
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,740
In America,

265
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:01,680
two scientists were working around the clock.

266
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:05,610
Gc had successfully completed trials with their jet engines.

267
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,930
The Bell Aircraft Corporation was contracted to supply an experimental plane to test.

268
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,460
On October,

269
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:18,210
the first one thousand nine hundred and forty two amidst great secrecy,

270
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:22,530
America's first jet aircraft called the X P fifty nine and eight,

271
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:23,430
was flown at Meir,

272
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:24,930
a Dry lake in California.

273
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,130
But the tests were disappointed.

274
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:33,600
The aircraft could only manage a maximum speed of three hundred and ninety miles per hour.

275
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:37,290
This speed was below many of the German and allied piston powered planes.

276
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,900
But the X P fifty nine A,

277
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:46,200
did play an important part in the race and wants to be the foundation of America's future jet aircraft industry.

278
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:57,570
The American Turbojet Development program proceeded a slow pace because the overall objective of the American military was to win the war with the weapons at hand.

279
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,620
The construction in large numbers of conventional piston engined aircraft,

280
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:06,300
such as the North American Pvt one Mustang and the Boeing be seventeen.

281
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:08,760
Those were seen as the weapons it would win the war,

282
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:08,910
so,

283
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:11,370
looking at jet technology,

284
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:13,140
it was seen as a long term development.

285
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,590
Yet in Germany,

286
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:22,020
the Emmy to six to was given top priority as it went through a period of intense evaluation.

287
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,360
In May,

288
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:24,630
nine thousand,

289
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:25,650
nine hundred and eighty three,

290
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:26,280
the Luftwaffe,

291
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:31,320
his most famous areas and of Garland flew the Emmy to substitute for the first time.

292
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,350
After the flight,

293
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:38,010
he was a main saying This is not a step forward.

294
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:38,820
This is a leap.

295
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,040
He also described the flight as like being pushed by angels.

296
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,650
Hitler to was becoming more and more excited about the plane's performance.

297
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,070
with his right now coming under daily attacks from allied bombers,

298
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:59,760
he ordered the Emmy to six to to be put into full scale production,

299
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:01,260
not only as a fighter,

300
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,360
but also was a bummer.

301
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,670
He felt that if he had one thousand jet bombers,

302
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:09,300
they could halt or at least delay the expected Allied invasion.

303
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,780
Messerschmitt Segura,

304
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:13,500
Mr Smith,

305
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,170
had been asked if you could drop bombs with it.

306
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:18,450
Of course you could drop bombs on it.

307
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:21,960
But that was not what it had been built for land.

308
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:25,140
Two bombs were only fitted underneath because we'd been ordered to do so.

309
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,720
Some blame teachers and others tried to put the blame elsewhere.

310
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:31,260
All nonsense.

311
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:41,130
The confusion and trying to build freighter versions and modify the plan to be Obama would be a disastrous mistake.

312
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,700
On June,

313
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:48,420
the sixth one thousand,

314
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:53,340
nine hundred and ninety nine for the Allies successfully landed on the beaches of France.

315
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,050
The invasion of Europe had begun.

316
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,460
Vainly the Germans tried to throw the invaders back,

317
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:04,500
but with the allies have incomplete air superiority and with no operational Emmy to six too,

318
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:05,460
is available.

319
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,200
The Germans were forced to retreat.

320
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,060
On hearing this,

321
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:16,440
it is reported that Hitler flew into a rage and two days after the day,

322
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:20,280
he announced a few rabbits and order of the leader,

323
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:23,760
which demanded the Emmy to six to be made only as a bomber.

324
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,130
Despite Hitler's orders,

325
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:33,450
limited numbers of the fighter version did come off the production line.

326
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,610
They were quickly rushed to the training schools.

327
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,060
Destined to be flown by the elite.

328
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:43,920
It was here that the cream of the German Luftwaffe and saw the Emmy to six to for the first time.

329
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,670
Training for professionals,

330
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:50,010
We were surprised when we first saw it standing there.

331
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,080
The gun that was really not credible,

332
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,470
the training of these pilots was given top priority,

333
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:00,360
but with the tide of war running against them,

334
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,640
there was little time for classroom tactics.

335
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,360
You are full of the training.

336
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:09,660
It was a very simple via tag for half days of lessons.

337
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,570
Then you had to do your first flight on your own because the machines were single seasons.

338
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,190
One day we had to give our work that we would not damage the machines.

339
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:28,770
otherwise we would be punished or immediately sent back to the units we can try it out for their own economies.

340
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,780
With that warning,

341
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:34,110
uppermost in their minds even for these experienced pilots,

342
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:35,970
the first flights were always known.

343
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,480
Again,

344
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:43,800
if a sergeant who was on the wing explained to me the interior of the plain facts,

345
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,180
especially what to look out for.

346
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,460
For example,

347
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:51,960
the guests for the engine was only stepped on very slowly in each day,

348
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,400
otherwise the engine would stall.

349
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,460
The turbine engine had to get used to the speed very slowly,

350
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:00,780
so one had to be very careful.

351
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,480
Joshua of Persons once in the air,

352
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:13,350
the experience of flying and Emmy to six to surpassed all their expectations from Pfleger Yeltsin.

353
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,690
here for any pilot passionate about flying.

354
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:18,090
It was a most extraordinary experience,

355
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:22,050
especially so because the roaring engine was not in front of your news.

356
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:23,280
All the noise was behind.

357
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:23,430
You.

358
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,230
A wonderful thing.

359
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,310
Our solution.

360
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,010
The speed was really enormous.

361
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,580
And the flying characteristics were so advantageous.

362
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,420
You actually had a sense of confidence in that machine.

363
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,560
Although the German pilots would praise the takeoff and speed at the plane,

364
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:49,020
it was the landing that gave them problems.

365
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:55,860
I don't have no one to nine Plain one could just switch off the engine and drift done slowly.

366
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,260
But in this plane it wasn't possible at all.

367
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,800
I was traveling at a speed of four hundred and five hundred miles per hour and couldn't reduce it.

368
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,410
The plane just wouldn't descend.

369
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:16,350
I looked at the altitude meter and had to fly in circles until I finally reached an altitude of three thousand feet then asked for permission to land,

370
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:19,590
I lowered the landing gear and slowly approached the runway.

371
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,180
Finally,

372
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:26,790
I was able to learn to see if anyone was greatly relieved and contrast to my usual take off in London.

373
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:33,090
It was completely soaked with sweat and the seeking new flu shots and learn a lot as its creatures.

374
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,160
Initially,

375
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:38,460
it was planned that only fighter aces would fly the plane,

376
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:42,390
but four years of war had taken its toll on the left above his finest,

377
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:43,950
so regular planets,

378
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:48,090
some with as little as ten hours' flying experience were drafted in.

379
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:50,040
But for inexperienced pilots,

380
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,370
the Emmy to six to was not an easy plan to fly,

381
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:56,910
and over two hundred pilots were killed in training alone.

382
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:59,160
That's a really funny is,

383
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,120
of course,

384
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:03,810
the first ones to whom I count myself as well.

385
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:04,590
We were the best.

386
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:13,470
But those who followed us we're often at the beginning of their pilot training and didn't cope with the machine that's going to put.

387
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,100
those people in.

388
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:15,810
The jet was totally irresponsible.

389
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,720
We had young,

390
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:19,560
glossy standard.

391
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:22,920
By mid nine thousand,

392
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,030
nine hundred and ninety four,

393
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:26,580
those pilots that had survived the training was sent.

394
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:33,900
A newly formed squadrons ground crews to wear hastily recruited to service and maintain these new wonder weapon.

395
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,850
We have found,

396
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:40,470
generally speaking,

397
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:46,410
my experience was that the ground crew tried very hard to ensure that the planes were always ready for takeoff.

398
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:55,980
I did not get to know them well enough because I've always had to be ready for action and was waiting for an emergency takeoff.

399
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,110
That's how long standards.

400
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:01,380
sometimes that does not happen at all.

401
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,470
Hence the saying half of one's life.

402
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:05,250
It's on weights,

403
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,110
invasion of dementia games.

404
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,370
Oh,

405
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:11,610
yeah.

406
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:16,740
Stem?

407
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,810
Yet the waiting was short lived,

408
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:24,480
with thousands of bombers now pounding Germany.

409
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:25,320
Every available.

410
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:26,790
Pilots was thrown into action.

411
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,310
Just go.

412
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,210
On July,

413
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:51,780
two thousand and nine thousand,

414
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:52,020
one thousand,

415
00:27:52,021 --> 00:28:01,320
nine hundred and ninety nine an Emmy to six to became the first jet airplane to be used in combat when it shot down a British photo reconnaissance mosquito flying over Munich.

416
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:09,870
It now appeared that the race for the jet fighter had been won and with it the prize of victory in the skies,

417
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:12,270
which was now within the liftoff as grubs.

418
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,060
During the late summer of one thousand,

419
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:24,960
nine hundred and ninety nine more and more German lived for pilots were taking their new Emmy to six to jet fighters into battle.

420
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:30,570
It seemed as though finally they now had a weapon that could beat the Allied bombers and their high speed escort.

421
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,850
This British spying in March there were two groups of four mustangs in close formation,

422
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:42,750
and they were so incredibly confident they hadn't seen me,

423
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,300
and that was a mistake.

424
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:46,530
I'm sharing the young,

425
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:47,400
some guys Yankees,

426
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,360
are.

427
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:51,060
I actually felt sorry for the guys is they hadn't noticed me?

428
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,100
I came from deep,

429
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:53,370
low,

430
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:57,570
right and flew in there we had four thirty millimeter guns the mark,

431
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,890
one of eight.

432
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,870
there was an incredible fire,

433
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,420
because the whole thing presented itself to me.

434
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,280
I was a long outstretched point.

435
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:06,330
You couldn't actually miss.

436
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,000
And then two fighters dropped down.

437
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,250
With one I saw a parachute travel with the other one.

438
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:14,700
I didn't.

439
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,640
That was such a case.

440
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,110
By late one thousand,

441
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:27,420
nine hundred and ninety four to six tubes were attacking the Allied bombers with devastating effect,

442
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:31,080
Allied fighter and bomber crews were unsure how to deal with them.

443
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:35,610
Their speed and firepower with just two is so close to the ground.

444
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:37,020
We couldn't get a shot.

445
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,870
And then he goes.

446
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,500
My fellows and I just said the graphical we just saw a real pilot.

447
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:03,750
We were jumped by nearly two hundred and sixty two and only got a very short glimpse of him because he made an attack from about three o'clock and he came down through the group.

448
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,240
Went by so fast,

449
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:07,410
we can only see him.

450
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,600
It was really shocked because it was like nothing that we'd seen before.

451
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,020
The German pilots had not felt such supremacy in the air since the early days of the war.

452
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:25,560
They felt sure that this incredible plane would turn the tide dial floaters and decent alarm.

453
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:31,200
I flew to the area around Dresden and went down to sixteen thousand feet.

454
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:35,370
I started to fighter planes as they were above me,

455
00:30:35,371 --> 00:30:40,590
I increased my altitude and I took one of the fighter planes in my sights.

456
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:41,160
In those days,

457
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:41,610
the machine,

458
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:43,860
guns and cannons were automatically switched on.

459
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,680
I had full cannons and I gave off a burst of fire damage,

460
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,210
and before I knew it,

461
00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:55,020
the pilot parachuted out of his plane where I had hit him.

462
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:55,740
I did not know.

463
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,710
It was all very new,

464
00:30:58,711 --> 00:30:59,670
much too fast.

465
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:01,530
Jim was watching.

466
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:02,430
It often has a silence,

467
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:02,670
guns,

468
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:03,720
volume features,

469
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,630
and then suddenly I saw the second fighter plane in front of me.

470
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,300
And I fired at it,

471
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,050
and it went down,

472
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,990
surrounded by smoke that looked like a flag.

473
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:13,980
Starting its army.

474
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,190
But it was the bombers that were the Emmy to six two's real prey.

475
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,050
Lift of Autopilot,

476
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:27,330
Alfred Arms was on a routine patrol when he came across a be seventeen on its thirteen commission.

477
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,400
Tito shook the system.

478
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:35,820
Everyone quickly chose a plane without having any great discussions about whether they were going to take this or the other player poses.

479
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:36,270
Instead,

480
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,510
you would say the best position for me is the one in the middle.

481
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:40,260
That's not a role.

482
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:42,090
There were enough planes in the sky,

483
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:43,470
which made it easy to pick one image.

484
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,690
The rear gather in that particular be seventeen was nineteen year old,

485
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:50,130
Craig Bennett.

486
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,140
He came so fast.

487
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:56,640
all you had time was just pull the triggers and let the guns fire.

488
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,160
Aim the Ms Bastion,

489
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:00,090
cut out this night.

490
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,920
I was aiming at a fortress when suddenly ahead of me,

491
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:14,850
there was a large wall of fire into which the captain of my squadron and others disappeared in alchemy,

492
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:15,510
fresh ones.

493
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,220
The first plane was the leader and he hit our plane.

494
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,390
The plane just blew up.

495
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,210
The whole brain exploded his plane and ours.

496
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,530
Uber defy a bicycle autumn.

497
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:34,920
I was able to fly over the wall of fame.

498
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:41,220
It turned out that the fortress had exploded and taken to adjacent flames with AMC hit safely.

499
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,530
That's how big the explosion was.

500
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,420
So if you think about the explosion footmen.

501
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,370
And the tail broke off.

502
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,490
and started falling.

503
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,550
And the rest of the plane was gone.

504
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,430
I was only one.

505
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:00,450
they got out of my eye.

506
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,210
Craig Bennett was to spend.

507
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:04,620
The rest of the war is a peer,

508
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:05,040
W.

509
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,640
Yet it was not all a one sided fight.

510
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:14,280
Once they got over the shock of these new wonder weapons,

511
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:18,600
the Allied pilots slowly began to learn how to deal with the German gentlemen.

512
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:26,220
The first problem was how to overcome the huge speed disadvantage the pilot's found that when they put the Mustang into a steep dive,

513
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,770
their speed was the same as the Emmy to six too.

514
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,760
So I just bent the throttle as far as it goes forward,

515
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,350
without going through the stop.

516
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,090
And?

517
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,330
Slowly,

518
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:39,960
very,

519
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:44,610
very slowly start gain a little on the guy because he was making a little term.

520
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:45,780
And each time you turn a little bit,

521
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:46,710
I get a little closer.

522
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,190
When I finally got up raids,

523
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:52,440
this guy was inexperienced.

524
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:53,760
Sure,

525
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,700
as when he saw the first tracers,

526
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,210
either no.

527
00:33:57,211 --> 00:33:59,250
by hammer hit his airplane,

528
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:00,660
he made a turn.

529
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:02,700
If you to put his nose down,

530
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:03,300
how do we run?

531
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:04,080
We probably know God.

532
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,020
A movie where we've gotten range.

533
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:16,200
The Allied pilots also found that the Emmy to six to did not respond US quake in a turn as propeller planes.

534
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,870
This would have deadly consequences.

535
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:29,040
I was on the inside of his circle and I was able to get a bead on him and shoot in front of him,

536
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,960
so he would fly into the bullets.

537
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,840
But it was on takeoff and landing at the Emmy to six too,

538
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,070
with at its most vulnerable.

539
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,600
Allied pilots lay in wait around the airfields.

540
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,940
Hundreds of two six two pilots were to dine.

541
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:49,380
In this way.

542
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:55,260
the Americana see the Americans change their tactics to concentrate on all their fields,

543
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,390
where jet fighter units with station I live.

544
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,760
This way they were able to hit us when we were most vulnerable.

545
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:06,540
We were like during startup and landing for boats.

546
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,430
Postage tend to get rid of this.

547
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:10,890
where their start during takeoff.

548
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,300
We did not have enough speed.

549
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,730
And when landing,

550
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:16,830
we had to reduce it.

551
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,150
That was the problem.

552
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:19,380
this we're just picking.

553
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,130
With the tide of war turning against them,

554
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:30,270
the Emmy to six to superiority in the skies was over.

555
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:38,190
More and more planes were being shot down and fear was ever present in the remaining pilots mines to get out and come down.

556
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:43,290
The thoughts would only enter your head at a later stage when within the squadron,

557
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:47,100
nearly every third or fourth person had to be replaced every week.

558
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,230
The longer the war lasted,

559
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:54,270
the more this occurred.

560
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,640
I believe this led to the end of the wall,

561
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:57,720
some in difficulty.

562
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,870
Furious that the new jet squadrons were being wasted by the German High Command,

563
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:07,320
and under insistence of General Galland and other famous essays,

564
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:12,720
is Hitler reluctantly allowed every twentieth Amy to six to to be built as a fighter.

565
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,600
That's about thirty feet and having a bastion,

566
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,490
it was a completely wrong thing to do.

567
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,750
And some of the bombers were used as night fighters.

568
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,920
they had totally misjudge.

569
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:27,450
The situation can only assume that they were following their own delusion.

570
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:31,500
Feedback about the infamous fear of Bethel.

571
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:35,220
The order of the leader was at last rescinded in late one thousand,

572
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,780
nine hundred and ninety four.

573
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:41,550
Hitler finally ordered that all Emmy to six tubes should now be built as fighters.

574
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,750
With the allies marching into Germany,

575
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:46,710
was it to little?

576
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,800
By early one thousand,

577
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:56,910
nine hundred and ninety five,

578
00:36:56,911 --> 00:37:00,030
and with nearly all her factories destroyed by the Allies,

579
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:05,190
Germany was finding it almost impossible to produce the jet fighters so desperately needed.

580
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,110
So a novel solution was brought about.

581
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,540
If I feel new.

582
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,510
The bombing did slow everything down.

583
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,740
But if we had enough material,

584
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:19,500
we could have manufactured the required numbers.

585
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:20,520
Let's say forty,

586
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,570
three or forty four.

587
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
The rain fiancee fiance Betsy,

588
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:25,590
in the end,

589
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:28,860
we got used to it more went into the woods,

590
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:31,050
where we put up large shelters.

591
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:37,080
Camouflage tennis manufactured throughout Germany.

592
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:42,090
Sections of the Emmy to six to were then delivered under cover of darkness by truck,

593
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:42,870
horse and cart,

594
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:46,710
and even bicycles to be fully assembled in forests.

595
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,050
Over eight hundred were to be built in this way.

596
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,240
But as more and more Emmy to six tubes were being destroyed by allied fighters,

597
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,970
so too with the cream of the German live together.

598
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,530
One day a plane came crashing down above me and my plane caught fire.

599
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,460
I had to bail out.

600
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,550
That's how I had to land with my parachute.

601
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,130
And that was the end of the war.

602
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:14,610
For me.

603
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,560
If I am a Canadian,

604
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:23,400
there was suddenly a big bang for a couple of brief moments.

605
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,100
I did not look back as I would usually do.

606
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,990
I was looking in the sky to see what had happened.

607
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,560
There was a flash some way.

608
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh,

609
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:33,210
then,

610
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:34,020
I saw the engine.

611
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,900
what was catching fire than the ice At that stage,

612
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:39,690
I was about four thousand feet above the layer of clouds.

613
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,850
Upon seeing the fire,

614
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:44,550
I immediately dived into the clouds,

615
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:48,630
have changed course and turned left in order to get out of the line of fire.

616
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:51,660
so far nothing spake of him full in shape.

617
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,430
I wanted to jump up with a parachute.

618
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,580
Then I remembered that someone had once told me that if you are too frightened to jump off,

619
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:01,620
then push the joystick to the side,

620
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:06,810
and it will stand on it with your foot stage and push yourself up.

621
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,190
That's what I did establish the matter.

622
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,350
Towards the end of the war,

623
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:23,310
there simply were not enough trained pilots to fly the jet fighter.

624
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:28,080
Even if there had been the production of the Emmy to six to had ground to a halt,

625
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:32,760
they simply could not build enough jet fighters to stem the tide of the conquering allies.

626
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,340
Germany finally surrendered on May,

627
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:43,620
the seventh one thousand nine hundred and forty five.

628
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:47,820
as cities and factories were totally smashed so too,

629
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:49,560
with her jet aircraft industry.

630
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,430
In the following months,

631
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:53,820
Britain,

632
00:39:53,821 --> 00:40:01,260
America and Russia squabbled over the carcasses of the wonder jets that were scattered throughout Germany and picking through the bones,

633
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:04,140
they began to build their own jet aircraft industries.

634
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,330
In an operation called operation Lusty.

635
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:10,470
Under the command of kernel,

636
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:11,340
Watson,

637
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:14,340
the Americans gathered all the German planes they could find.

638
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,240
They were flown to Cherbourg in France and then shipped to America for revaluation.

639
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:33,450
Watson's wizards were a group of American pilots tasked with capturing flying German aircraft to the French coast and bringing them back to the United States for testing and evaluation,

640
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:37,140
a commitment to getting this new technology back to the United States,

641
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:39,990
and they were actually racing against the British and the Soviets.

642
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:45,060
To do this would ensure that America would have an aeronautical superiority.

643
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:47,520
In the postwar period,

644
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:55,020
the Americans began an extensive testing program of the MIT to six tubes by analyzing the jet turbines and wind design.

645
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:56,610
At this German fighter,

646
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:59,190
they were able to produce their own design,

647
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:00,750
which was to become the fabulous.

648
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:02,010
At eighty six saver.

649
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,980
It's not until the German jet technology that's brought over through operation,

650
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:10,980
lusty and other programs that aircraft,

651
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:21,210
like North American and eighty six with its webbed Wayne especially reflect the German technology and the way to design a proper and efficient jet airplane.

652
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,110
The Russians also dealt into the Emmy to six to the secrets and,

653
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:32,670
with the help of British jet's technology would later build then make fifty.

654
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,290
Really,

655
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:39,630
the boost for the Russian engineer in history was what they captured from the Germans at the end of the Second World War.

656
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:40,950
The main thing,

657
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:41,160
though,

658
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:42,360
really for the Russian aircraft.

659
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:52,200
and she was when we get then our latest injured and that allowed to make fifteen to go from being an average aircraft with good design to a world beater.

660
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,320
Along with the enemy to six years moved to America when designer Hans von Hohenheim,

661
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:02,400
he was to become the chief scientist of error Propulsion for the United States' efforts.

662
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,060
Frank would eventually moved to America,

663
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:10,200
where he became a consultant on several aviation projects.

664
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:11,280
Vilhelm meshes meets.

665
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:17,490
The father of the Emmy to six two remained in Germany and helps in rebuilding their shattered aircraft industry.

666
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:24,180
Hundreds of allied aircraft were to fall victim to the Emmy to six too.

667
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:26,190
but at a terrible price,

668
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:30,660
hardly any of the four thousand eight hundred Emmy to six tubes that were built survived the war.

669
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:38,460
Yet many people still believe that if the Emmy to six to had entered service earlier,

670
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:40,590
it couldn't save Germany from defeat.

671
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:49,470
The future Buddha there has been a lot of speculation and perhaps if they could have introduced the whole program half a year earlier.

672
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,960
But if you are truthfully,

673
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:58,410
would it have decided to walk or tricks only the gods know reason isn't a good?

674
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:01,890
Germany had won the race to get a jet fighter into the air.

675
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:04,080
it outclassed all its rivals,

676
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,690
and in its short operational life of seven months,

677
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:11,400
the Emmy to six to had pushed forward the frontiers of air combat to new heights.

678
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,520
This was best at the time it was the best fighter plane in the world.

679
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,370
And as an aircraft.

680
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,960
It was an exceptional solution exceptional illusion.

681
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,920
We were surprised that the others could not do that,

682
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:31,260
and it's like the one that does the mmd chimerical.

683
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:39,510
The Emmy to six to was undoubtedly one of the most famous airplanes in the whole history of German aviation.

684
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:40,350
If not the world.

685
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,090
Born out of a need to be a fearsome destroyed from the day at first flew,

686
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:50,520
it spelled the end of propeller driven aircraft and heralded the dawning of the new jet.
