1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,660
1944年中期 
By the middle of 1944

2
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,800
盟军投入1000架轰炸机
Allied forces were regularly flying raids of 1,000 bombers over Nazi Germany,

3
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,410
在P51野马等远航程战斗机护航下对纳粹德国定期轰炸
Escorted by powerful, long range sightings like the P51 Mustang

4
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:38,850
德国空军无力抵抗这庞大的空中舰队
the German Luftwaffe could put up little resistance to these vast air armadas 

5
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,820
但是在1944年7月
But in July 1944

6
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:46,170
一种新式德国战斗机出现在天空中
a new German fighter appeared in the skies,

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,250
其飞行时速比野马高出100多英里
capable of flying over one hundred miles per hour faster than the Mustang,

8
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,980
并且装备了4门30mm口径的机炮
and armed with four thirty millimeter cannons.

9
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:57,000
可以摆脱护航战斗机并一次性将轰炸机全部摧毁
It could outmaneuver the escorts and destroy a bomber in a single pass. 

10
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,180
德军的新战机
The new German fighter,

11
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:05,400
这种让盟军飞行员恐惧，并且让德国空军认为自己不可战胜的
which put fear into the allied pilots and made the German Luftwaffe feeling invincible.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,540
正是喷气式的梅塞施密特262
Was the jet propelled Messerschmitt 262

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,380
我第一次看见德国的喷气机Me262时，
The first time I saw a German jet, the Me262

14
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,370
我简直不敢相信 它跑的这么快
I could hardly believe it how fast it was.

15
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,180
*听不清


16
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,700
这次我们不再是猎物，而是猎人
At this time we were again not the hunted,but the hunters.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,380
*所以我们现在有信心取胜
So now we won with a ego.

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,160
使用出色的影像档案和*色彩再现，
Using extraordinary archive film and color re-enactments,

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,570
《Battle Stations》节目将会深入速度之争，探索航空史上第一种投入实战的喷气战斗机
Battle stations dives into the high speed world of the race to get the first jet fighter ever to fly in combat.

20
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,240
梅塞施密特262 : 喷气竞赛
Messerschmitt 262：RACE FOR THE JET

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,380
讽刺的是，令盟军恐惧的Me262的起源是一张和平条约
Ironically, the origins of the fearsome Messerschmitt 262 were born out of a peace treaty.

22
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,450
在一战战败后
Following its defeat in World War One,

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,020
德国被同盟国强制签署禁止发展常规飞行技术的协定，
Germany was forced by the allies to sign an agreement which banned them from developing further conventional aircraft technologies,

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,540
然而其中并未提及火箭和喷气推进技术。
that rockets and jet propulsion would never mentioned.

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,400
1930年，
in the 1930s

26
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:12,150
元首开始描绘纳粹德国的蓝图
Adolf Hitler began to build his vision for Nazi Germany.

27
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,630
其中包括世界最强的空军
That vision included the most powerful air force in the world.

28
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,480
为达到这一目标，空军必须有高航速
To achieve this, the airforce must have speed.

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,280
当时，
At that time,

30
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,310
人们认识到，飞得更快意味着需要飞的更高
It was realized that to fly faster meant flying higher,

31
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,900
因为高处空气更稀薄
where the air is thinner.

32
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,730
但当飞行高度增加，
but the higher a plane flies,

33
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:32,490
螺旋桨就更难牵引飞机前进
the harder it is for a propeller to draw it through the air.

34
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,850
在德国哥廷根大学，一位年轻的工程师 汉斯·冯·奥海恩开始了涡轮喷气引擎的研究
At the German University of Göttingen a young engineer named Hans von Ohain began development work on a turbo jet engine.

35
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,460
汉斯·冯·奥海恩是个十分优秀的学生，
他第一次完成喷气引擎的构想时仅有21岁
A brilliant student Hans von Ohain was only twenty one years old when he first conceived the idea of a jet engine.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,590
There's one.

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,570
他是个好学的技术人员
He was a technician with an inquisitive mind.

38
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:03,180
他非常擅长解决理论问题
He was very good at theoretical problems,

39
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,560
而且他也在学习物理
and he studied physics as well.

40
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,370
If you tried it.

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,210
受到他教授的鼓舞，
Encouraged by his professor,

42
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,880
这位年轻工程师开始着手制造原型
the young engineer began to build a working prototype.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,270
此时的英国，
Meanwhile, in Britain,

44
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:21,300
全然不知德国发生的事，26岁的皇家空军飞行员弗兰克·惠特尔
totally unaware of what was happening in Germany,a 26 year old Royal Air Force pilots named Frank Whittle,

45
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,030
正在研发一种燃气涡轮引擎
was developing a gas turbine engine.

46
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,050
1932年
in 1932

47
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,660
他提交了世界上第一份喷气引擎的专利
He filed a patent on the world's first jet engine.

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,960
在这个早期片段中
In this early film,

49
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,440
弗兰克·惠特尔亲自解释了引擎的原理
Frank Whittle himself explains the principles of his engine.

50
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,420
这代表一个离心压缩机
This represents a centrifugal type compressor.

51
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:45,210
用这个在前端吸入空气，像这样压缩进入燃烧室
I use this to pull in air at the front and to compress it into combustion chambers like this,

52
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:53,100
这里会注入燃料并燃烧，使空气膨胀，让它有足够的能量驱动压缩机的涡轮
where the injection of burning the fuel ** and expand the air and gives it enough energy to drive a turbine which drives the compressor.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
这个设计将会成为世界上第一个完全可行的喷气引擎
This design was to become the world's first fully working jet engine.

54
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,280
但惠特尔发现很难让英国军方重视他的设计
But Whittle found it difficult to get his design taken seriously by the British military establishment.

55
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,400
当时科学家，即当权者的建议是这个设计不可行
The scientific advice at that time and i.e by the people in power was it couldn't work.

56
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,860
让它正常工作需要过多的能量
It required just too much power to make it work.

57
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:17,010
军方人员听取了这个建议
And the officials at the ministry listened to that advice,

58
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:27,210
*惠特尔被视作妄想用当时无法实现的想法一举成名的人
and Whittle was very much seen as a bit of an upstart that was trying to sort of make his name and push forward an idea that was not really achievable at that time. 

59
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:32,910
对惠特尔的阻碍导致的延期，之后将成为德国喷气引擎研究的显著优势
The delays, which were to hamper Whittle were to prove a distinct advantage for German jet engine development.

60
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,540
1935年
By 1935

61
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:45,330
汉斯在导师建议下，通过飞机制造商亨克尔的经济支持完成了测试引擎
Hans von Ohain had developed a test engine on the advice of his professor approach the aircraft manufacturer Ernst Hanckel for financial support.

62
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,200
亨克尔作为激进理念的赞助者而出名
Hanckel was known as a patron of radical concepts,

63
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:54,840
他特别看重那些能提高速度，让他能建造世界最快飞机的技术
especially those which would lead to higher speeds and enable him to build the fastest airplane in the world.

64
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,540
亨克尔对此印象深刻
他意识到这种引擎的巨大潜力，要求制造全尺寸型号
 Impressed, Heinkel recognize the enormous potential of such an engine and ordered the construction of a fullscale *power plant.

65
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,990
汉斯和他的工程师团队接受了任务，
开始研发亨克尔HeS 3引擎
Ohain and his team of engineers accepted the task and set to work on what would become the HES 3 jet engine.

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
回到英国，
Back in Britain,

67
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:21,900
惠特尔终于筹到了开一间小公司的钱
Whittle had finally managed to raise enough funds to establish a small company.

68
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,270
公司建立在莱斯特郡的拉特沃思小镇
Located in the little Leicestershire town of Lutterworth,

69
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:29,100
他将其命名为Power Jets
he called it powered jets.

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,950
1937年
In 1937,

71
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,750
他第一次测试引擎
he tested his engine for the first time.

72
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:44,430
惠特尔遇到了各种问题*
Whittle had all sorts of problems when the engine on pairing up ran away with itself and just kept going and going the thrust built up,

73
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:49,020
惠特尔就站在那看着机器爆炸，因为他已经被吓坏了
and Whittle just stood there and waited for it to go bang because he was just transfixed by it.

74
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,300
但同时他也被这个情景所吸引
He also was enthralled by what was happening.

75
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,710
这台机器是他的孩子
This was his baby,

76
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:54,750
惠特尔不想让它破裂
and he didn't want it to break fall apart.

77
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:55,830
他正在悉心照顾这台机器
He was looking after it.

78
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:58,710
即便其他所有人都明智地立马跑路了
Although everyone else sensibly left the area very quickly.

79
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,990
尽管有许多挫折与失败
Despite many setbacks and failures,

80
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:13,470
惠特尼最终掌控了他的引擎
which will finally succeeded in controlling his engine.

81
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,900
但是英国政府仍未被说服
but the British government was still not convinced,

82
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,200
政府更倾向传统的飞机和引擎设计
preferring instead conventional designs for aircraft and engines.

83
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,440
惠特尔的发明在整个30年代面临重重阻力
Whittle face resistance to his invention throughout the 1930s.

84
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:30,540
先前的喷气推进测试表明涡桨飞机将会很重，
Previous experiments with jet propulsion indicated that turboprops will be heavy,

85
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,690
昂贵且不可靠
expensive and very unreliable.

86
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:37,380
英国航空部和皇家空军认为
The British Air Ministry and the Royal aircraft establishment saw,

87
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:44,550
喷气推进要想成为飞机动力的可行替代方案，至少还有10至15年的路要走
that turbo jets were not going to be a viable alternative for Aero propulsion until ten or fifteen years down the road.

88
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,220
与此同时
Throughout this time,

89
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:51,090
惠特尔并不知道德国人也在研发喷气引擎
Frank Whittle did not know that the Germans were developing a jet engine.

90
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,970
项目的保密非常完善
So good was the secrecy surrounding the project.

91
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:58,230
研发内容从不为人所知
Little was known about what was being developed at all 

92
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:05,250
当时，惠特尔35年的专利被发布在德国的技术杂志上
Whittle's patents, which were released in 35 and were published in Germany in German in the technical magazines at that time,

93
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,830
汉斯得知了这一切
made available to * von Ohain,

94
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:12,120
惠特尔已经注册了很多专利
a lot of material Whittle it previously had as a patent,

95
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:16,860
可以这么说，汉斯已经在阅读这些内容
and now I think it would be fair to say at that time that von Ohain would have gone down the road of reading these,

96
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:17,940
他不会抄袭
he wouldn't have copied it,

97
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,390
但他一定会阅读并且运用到他自己的领域中
but he would certainly have read it and interpreted it into the zones he was involved in.

98
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,490
当战争阴云开始笼罩
As the clouds of war gathered on the horizon,

99
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,120
纳粹政权对开发高速的推进技术更为执着
the Nazi regime had become more determined than ever to develop faster forms of propulsion for its *lift off.

100
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,610
1938年
in 1938,

101
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:42,960
帝国航空部签发了德国航空工业规范
the Reich Air Ministry issued a specification to the German aviation industry.

102
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,230
一种单座喷气战斗机
A single seat turbo jet fighter.

103
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,250
被这道命令所推动
Spurred on by this directive,

104
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,110
亨克尔的团队推行这项计划
Heinkel's team pushed ahead,

105
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:55,380
设计一型装备奥海恩引擎的战机
designing an aircraft to be powered by Ohain's jet engines.

106
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,660
得益于绘图板上的两兄弟
From the drawing boards of twin brothers, Siegfried and Walter Gunter,

107
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:04,410
第一款实用型喷气动力飞机即将起飞
the first practical jet powered aircraft was to take flight.

108
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:06,840
命名为He-178
It was called the He-178.

109
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,020
1939年8月27日
On August the 27th 1939

110
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,960
在二战爆发前一周
one week before the outbreak of World War II,

111
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,510
小巧的He-178升空
the little Heinkel 178 took to the air.

112
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,780
德国人在喷气引擎竞赛中先行一步
The Germans had succeeded in being first in getting a jet air war.

113
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,830
但第一架喷气战斗机的竞赛才刚刚开始
But the race for the first jet fighter had only just begun.

114
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,840
1939年9月3日
On September the 3rd 1939,

115
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,120
二战开始
the Second World War began,

116
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,290
在接下来的几周时间里
and over the next few weeks,

117
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,200
德国人扫清了他们面前的一切
Germany swept all before them.

118
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,980
亨克尔和汉斯对喷气飞机的世界首飞兴奋不已，
Flushed with the success of having just flown the world's first jet aircraft,

119
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:59,560
*两个月后，他们可以向纳粹政府展示飞机了
It was two months before Ernst Heinkel and Hans von Ohain were able to demonstrate their plane to the Nazi government.

120
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,100
但随着纳粹军队所向披靡，传统空军主宰天空
But with its army conquering all and with its conventional airforce becoming masters of the skies,

121
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,920
德国人突然对喷气动力失去了兴趣
the Germans had suddenly lost interest in jet power.

122
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,850
He-178短暂而荣耀的一生结束，余生注定在柏林博物馆度过
The He-178 short but glorious life was over and was destined to spend the rest of his days in a Berlin museum.

123
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:31,300
但有坚定信念的人仍在默默地完善他自己的喷气飞机设计
But there were others in Germany who did not believe that the race for the first jet fighter was over quietly working on his own jet aircraft design.

124
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
这就是后来的Me-262
that would become the Me-262

125
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,300
设计者是杰出的41岁航空工程师：威利·梅塞施密特
was a brilliant 41 year old aeronautical engineer called Wilhelm Messerschmitt.

126
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,970
整个三十年代，梅塞施密特都是战斗机和轰炸机设计者和制造商
Throughout the thirties Messerschmitt had been a designer and manufacturer of bombers and fighters,

127
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:47,250
这正是纳粹高层所喜欢的项目
a favorite with the Nazi hierarchy,

128
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,440
他是个工作狂，*让所有共事的人都忠于他 
人们常说他很有艺术才能
he was a workaholic and created loyalty from all that knew him. *It was often he was very artistic.

129
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,820
周末在家时
At home over the course of a weekend,

130
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:00,750
他会在一张A4纸上设计飞机部件
he could design an aircraft part on an a4 sheet of paper,

131
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,350
图纸马上就能投入生产
and then the drawing would be ready to be taken into the workshop right away.

132
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:12,240
他可以完成非常好的设计，而且有着敏锐的直觉
His designs were that good. He was a very intuitive person,

133
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:18,420
但他有时也会大发雷霆
but he would lose his temper a lot.

134
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:23,940
然而这时，德国当局对喷气工业不再感兴趣
Yet whilst the German authorities appeared to have lost interest in their jet industry.

135
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:26,760
在英国，惠特尔终于时来运转
In Britain,Frank Whittles fortunes have changed.

136
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,860
在一系列冗长而沮丧的斗争后
After a long and frustrating battle,

137
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:34,530
英国航空部终于同意投资，并且建造一座工厂用于量产他的喷气引擎
The British Air Ministry finally agreed to finance and build a factory for him to manufacture his jet engine.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,320
验证惠特尔引擎的飞机订单给了格洛斯特航空公司
The Gloucester Aircraft Company was given the contract to produce an experimental plane that would prove Whittle's engines.

139
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:45,030
验证机名称为E.28
It was called the E.28.

140
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,360
最终在1941年5月15日
Finally on May the 15th 1941

141
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,920
在汉斯的He-178首飞20个月后，
20 months after Hans von Ohain He-178 had first flown,

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,490
格洛斯特E.28终于升空
The Gloucester E.28 took to the air.

143
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,280
首飞对于E.28来说意义重大，
The first flight to the E.28 was a significant event,

144
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:10,500
显然这是飞机可行性的最终验证
because obviously this was the final proof of the aircraft's operational use.

145
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,680
惠特尔一举成名
Whittle overnight became the success.

146
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,200
之前普遍认为飞机没有螺旋桨是无法起飞的，
但是他做到了。人们纷纷向他祝贺
He had achieved something that previously people thought wouldn't happen an aircraft flying with no propeller and they were suddenly having him congratulations well done Frank,

147
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,230
然后惠特尔转身解释说：这简直太TM适合飞行了
You know, and Frank were to turn around said well it was bloody well designed to fly.

148
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,570
人们十分振奋，其中包括美国陆军参谋长亨利·哈里·阿诺德
Amongst all this excitement was visiting American Army Chief of Staff General Henry Harley Arnold.

149
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:41,880
他确信这个英国发明可以为美国喷气技术带来很大帮助
He was convinced that this British invention could help to spring board America into the race for the jet.

150
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:50,100
对英国喷气机的飞行感到非常震惊之余
It was very surprised about the fact that the British had a jet engine aircraft flying,

151
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,700
他只能推测德国人的喷气机研发至少也是这个水准
and he can only speculate that the Germans were at least as far in their development of a jet aircraft as well.

152
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,540
怀着对新型喷气技术的热情和让美国海军赶上新技术的决心，
So, enthusiastic about the new jet technology and wanting to emphasize the U. S Navy catch up,

153
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:08,730
阿诺德和英国政府协商，将一个惠特尔引擎的样品带回美国
Arnold negotiated with the British government to bring an example of Whittle's engine to the United States,

154
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,400
这样，美国的喷气机项目就能起步了。
So the American turbojet program could begin.

155
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:20,910
大英首相丘吉尔也很希望美国对于参战的承诺，
因此同意移交惠特尔的喷气引擎
Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill was also eager to get the U. S committed to the British war effort and agreed to hand over whittle's jet designs.

156
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:29,670
丘吉尔的态度是：我们怎么才能把美国拖下水
Churchill's attitude was how can we involve America in our fight against the dictatorships.

157
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:42,900
*他认为通过赠送最新技术给美国，
可以让美国在之后转向支持英国
And he's seen the the fact that we would give this very latest development of technology to the Americans freely would help them appreciate this sort of problems we were in and later on maybe come down on our side.

158
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,270
惠特尔引擎的部件被迅速安排装箱
Hastily arrangements were made to box up Whittle’s engine parts and plans.

159
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,640
作为顶级机密，这箱宝贵的货物被轰炸机送往华盛顿
Amidst top secrecy, this precious cargo was loaded into a bomber and flown to a *bowling/Boeing? field In Washington, DC.

160
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,310
之后，引擎被送往位于麻省的通用电气公司工厂
It was then transported to the General Electric plants in Massachusetts.

161
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,120
不同于惠特尔的小规模研发
Unlike the small scale of development that Whittle facing in Great Britain,

162
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:17,760
美国人致力于调整和改进他的引擎
the American effort in modifying and improving his engine,

163
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,350
用大尺寸进行研制
United States was on a large scale.

164
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,020
在通用的工厂里
At the General Electric plant,

165
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:31,440
得益于在耐热高强度合金的丰富经验，通用改进了引擎，
最终成果就是GE *IA引擎 
the company used its experience in heat-resistant in a high-strength alloys to modify and improve what would eventually become the general electric *IA engines.

166
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:34,740
我认为这项工作的机密性和重要性再怎么强调也不为过
I cannot overemphasize the secrecy and the importance of this work.

167
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,300
大家都知道意呆利和德国人都在研发喷气技术
We know that both the Italians and the Germans are working on jets.

168
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,370
你们应该都知道一定不能让他们抢占先机
I hardly need to tell you that they must not win the race.

169
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,780
通过授予最高优先权
Given unlimited priority,

170
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:52,560
我们要在6个月内完成第一台机器
we will have the first unit running on task in six months.

171
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,160
与此同时在德国
Meanwhile, in Germany,

172
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,710
尽管纳粹政府对喷气技术漠不关心
Despite Nazi indifference to the jet,

173
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:01,530
亨克尔的团队还是在研发喷气战斗机
Heinkel's team continued to develop a jet fighter.

174
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,580
1941年3月30日
On March the 30th 1941,

175
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:08,070
亨克尔280第一次试飞
the Heinkel 280, had its first test flight.

176
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,620
汉斯洋洋得意地陶醉在这历史性的场景中
Triumphantly, Hans von Ohain was amongst those who reveled in this momentous occasion.

177
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,440
由他设计的引擎驱动，
Powered by his jet engine,

178
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:22,110
试验机设计极佳，速度可以超过每小时500英里
the plane was a superb design capable of speeds in excess of five hundred miles per hour.

179
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,840
领先所有竞争对手一大截
It was light years ahead of all its competitors.

180
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,300
这次测试飞行对亨克尔和汉斯都是巨大的个人成就
The test flight was a huge personal success for Heinkel and von Ohain

181
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:34,050
遗憾的是，*他们的飞机运气不佳
but sadly their jet fighter was not destined to be a winner.

182
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,770
亨克尔的核心问题是没有符合帝国空军部的要求，
因此无法获取合同
（无法找到匹配且可靠的引擎 [译者注]）
At the core of Heinkel's problem with getting contracts for operational jet and rocket aircraft was his inability to play by the rules of the Reich Air Ministry.

183
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:48,930
另一方面，梅塞施密特完全合规，因此获得大量合同
but on the other hand, Messerschmitt was able to play by the rules and was awarded with substantial contracts.

184
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,090
当1941年接近尾声时，
As 1941 drew to a close ,

185
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:57,690
英美德都加入了喷气研究
Britain America and Germany were all committed to jet development.

186
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:01,380
但对于美国来说 ，另一个事件让这个竞赛更为激烈
But for America another event made the race more intense.

187
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,240
1941年12月7日,
on December the 7th 1941,

188
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,040
日本偷袭珍珠港
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.

189
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,780
美国参战给对抗德国的盟军带来了急需的生命线
America's entry into World War II brought a much-needed lifeline to the allies in the battle against Germany.

190
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,910
全面的喷气机竞赛开始了
The full-blown race for the first jet fighter was now on.

191
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,170
英国政府终于批准惠特尔为战斗机研究喷气引擎
In Britain, the government had finally given the go ahead for Frank to develop a jet engine for a fighter.

192
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,870
美国通用公司恢复了所有暂停的研究
In America, General Electric was pulling out all the stops.

193
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:37,440
他们在6个月内生产引擎的计划进展顺利
Their promise to produce an engine within six months was on target.

194
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,660
同时在德国
And in Germany,

195
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:47,850
元首认为Me262是优秀的武器，要求梅塞施密特*提前投入量产
Hitler now saw the Me-262 as a wonder weapon and pushed Messerschmitt for an early completion to get the plane into production.

196
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:54,150
他们要我们继续研发，并批准梅塞施密特的一切提案
Do you wonder they wanted us to get a move on and granted permission to any of Messerschmitt's proposals.

197
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,030
德国喷气机工业正全速前进
The German jet aircraft industry was now moving forward at full speed.

198
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:03,000
研发和创新遍及各处
Research and innovation was everywhere.

199
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:08,070
设计师和工程师提出的概念超前好几年
Designers and engineers came up with concepts that were years in advance of their time.

200
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:15,540
机身后掠翼风洞试验让德国飞机制造商领先盟军
Wind tunnel tests into swept wings and fuselage configurations enable the German plane makers to be way ahead of the allies.

201
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:26,760
*我们参考估测以及计算、对比得出的结果，
直到有了那种感觉：
It was a mixture of calculations and calculate this and that and comparisons and was carrying out tells us until you got the feelings,

202
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:28,140
就是这个！
this was it,

203
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:32,580
然后他重构、测试、度量，乐在其中
And then he rebuilt it and tried it and measured it, and it was fun.

204
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,410
1942年7月18日
on July the 18th 1942,

205
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,720
*这是属于Me-262的一天 
the Me-262 made its day.

206
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,820
*首飞是有目的性的
At the first flight of the day was not without its *purpose.

207
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:56,370
我们陷入了困境：机尾无法抬升
We ran into difficulties when the plane's tail would not lift up,

208
00:16:56,371 --> 00:17:02,580
因此我们测试发现，如果飞行员在高速时缓慢减速
So we ran tests and discovered that if the pilot brakes gently at speed,

209
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,720
机尾就可以抬升了
then the tail would lift up. 

210
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,450
措施有效。当飞机时速达到120英里时
It worked. when the aircraft reached 120 miles per hour.

211
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:15,450
当飞行员轻触刹车，机头下降
The pilots touched the brakes, the nose dropped,

212
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,830
机尾抬升
the tale came up

213
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,620
Me-262成功升空
and the Me-262, took to the air.

214
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,650
Me-262在首飞测试中展示的性能相当惊人
The performance of the Me-262 with its test flight was incredible.

215
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:37,170
第二次飞行时，爬升到了11500英尺，最后时速为450英里
On its second fly to climb to 11,500 feet and
reached the speed of 450 miles per hour.

216
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:40,530
其他盟军飞机做得到吗？
already, it was faster than any allied planes in existence.

217
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,590
很快，德国飞行员就能在别人梦想的时速下飞行
Soon, German pilots would be flying at speeds that others could only have dreamt up.

218
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,640
但Me-262会成为元首的梦想战机吗？
But would the Me-262 be the answer to Hitler's dreams?

219
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,590
现在Me-262的喷气引擎可以让它的时速超过550英里(885km/h)
The Me-262's jet engines could now thrust it at speeds of over 550 miles  per hour.

220
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,020
可以轻易超过一切对手
It could simply outfly anything in the sky.

221
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,770
配备4门30mm口径机炮
Armed with four thirty millimeter cannons,

222
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:11,610
每一门都可以发射超过80发高爆弹
each was capable of delivering over eighty explosive shells into the enemy.

223
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,070
未来计划包括挂载24发空对空火箭弹
Future plans were also to include 24 wings slung air to air rockets.

224
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,190
代号“燕子”
Nicknamed the Swallow,

225
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,260
这一杰作预示着空战新纪元的黎明
This awesome machine heralded the dawning of a new age of battle .

226
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:31,350
对纳粹空军来说，它被寄予厚望
And for Hitler's Luftwaffe ,it was hoped that when it finally met the allied forces, it's hell would be unleashed.

227
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:45,060
这次成功的测试飞行最终说服了空军的将军们
The successful test flight of the German Me-262 had at last proved to the Luftwaffe generals.

228
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:48,240
这就是可以赢得战争的机器
This was the fighting machine that could win the war,

229
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:53,730
但在成为满足纳粹目标的无敌机器之前，仍有很多研发工作要做
but a lot of development work was still needed before it could become the all-conquering answer to Nazi dreams.

230
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,680
在美国，两位科学家夜以继日地工作。
In America, two scientists were working around the clock.

231
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:05,610
通用电气公司已经成功完成喷气引擎的试验
*Gec had successfully completed trials with their jet engines.

232
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,930
贝尔航空公司签订了一架实验机合同
The Bell Aircraft Corporation was contracted to supply an experimental plane to test.

233
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,210
1942年10月1日，在绝密护送下
On October the 1st 1942 amidst great secrecy,

234
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:22,530
美国第一架喷气实验机 XP-59a
America's first jet aircraft called the XP-59a,

235
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,930
在加利福尼亚莫洛克干湖起飞
was flown at Muroc Dry lake in California.

236
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,130
测试结果却令人失望
But the tests were disappointed.

237
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:33,600
飞机只能达到390英里的最大时速
The aircraft could only manage a maximum speed of 390 miles per hour.

238
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:37,290
这一速度比很多德国和盟军的活塞动力飞机还慢
This speed was below many of the German and allied piston powered planes.

239
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:46,200
但是XP-59a仍然是美国未来喷气机工业的重要基础
But the XP-59a, did play an important part in the race and was to be the foundation of America's future jet aircraft industry.

240
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:57,570
美国喷气研发进程缓慢，因为美国军方的普遍观点是用现有的武器赢得战争
The American Turbojet Development program proceeded a slow pace because the overall objective of the American military was to win the war with the weapons at hand.

241
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,620
The construction in large numbers of conventional piston engined aircraft,

242
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:06,300
例如P-51野马和B-17
such as the North American P-51 Mustang and the Boeing B-17.

243
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:08,760
这些看起来才是能赢得战争的武器
Those were seen as the weapons it would win the war,

244
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:13,140
因此审视喷气技术，这被看做是一项长期工程
So, looking at jet technology, it was seen as a long term development.

245
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,020
然而在德国，Me-262在紧张的评估过程中被提升到最高优先级
Yet in Germany, the Me-262 was given top priority as it went through a period of intense evaluation.

246
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,650
1943年五月
In May 1943,

247
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:31,320
帝国空军最著名的飞行员加兰德第一次驾驶Me-262
the Luftwaffe's most famous *areas Adolf Galland flew the Me-262 for the first time.

248
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,820
驾驶过后，他说：这不是一小步，而是一个飞跃
After the flight, he was a *main saying This is not a step forward. This is a leap.

249
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,040
他描述这次的飞行为：“像被天使推动一样”
He also described the flight as like being pushed by angels.

250
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,650
元首也对飞机的性能愈发激动
Hitler too was becoming more and more excited about the plane's performance.

251
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,070
面对即将到来的盟军轰炸机的日常攻击
with his right now coming under daily attacks from allied bombers,

252
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:59,760
他下令全力投产Me-262
he ordered the Me-262 to be put into full scale production,

253
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,360
不仅作为战斗机，还要有轰炸机的型号
not only as a fighter, but also was a bomber.

254
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,670
元首认为只要有一千架喷气轰炸机
He felt that if he had one thousand jet bombers,

255
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:09,300
纳粹就可以阻止，至少也能延缓盟军的攻势
they could halt or at least delay the expected Allied invasion.

256
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:16,170
梅塞施密特被元首问到是否可以在Me-262上装炸弹
Messerschmitt had been asked if you could drop bombs with it.

257
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:18,450
梅塞施密特回答到：当然可以用它来投弹
Of course you could drop bombs on it.

258
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,160
但这不是最初的设计目的
But that was not what it had been built for .

259
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,140
两枚炸弹仅仅被挂载在翼下，因为我们被元首要求这么做
And two bombs were only fitted underneath because we'd been ordered to do so.

260
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,340
部分意见被采纳，其他则完全不理会
Some blame *take for it and others tried to put the blame elsewhere.

261
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,640
完全是乱来
It was all nonsense

262
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:41,130
战斗机还是轰炸机的纠结将会是灾难性的错误
The confusion and trying to build freighter versions and modify the plan to be a bomber would be a disastrous mistake.

263
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,340
1944年6月6日，盟军成功在诺曼底登陆
On June the 6th 1944 the Allies successfully landed on the beaches of France.

264
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,050
欧洲攻势开始
The invasion of Europe had begun.

265
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,460
德国人想赶走盟军，结果只是徒劳
Vainly the Germans tried to throw the invaders back,

266
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:05,460
随着盟军夺取取制空权，而没有可用的Me-262
but with the allies having complete air superiority and with no operational Me-262 is available,

267
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,200
德国人被迫撤退
The Germans were forced to retreat.

268
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,600
听到这个消息，元首勃然大怒
On hearing this, it is reported that Hitler flew into a rage.

269
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,280
诺曼底登陆两天后， 
And two days after D-day, he announced a *fury befell and order of the leader,

270
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:23,760
下令Me-262只能生产轰炸机型
which demanded the Me-262 be made only as a bomber.

271
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,130
尽管有元首的命令
Despite Hitler's orders,

272
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:33,450
小批量的战斗机版本还是被生产出来
limited numbers of the fighter version did come off the production line.

273
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,610
这些飞机被火速送往飞行训练学校
They were quickly rushed to the training schools.

274
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,060
这是注定只有精英才能驾驭的机型
Destined to be flown by the elite.

275
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:43,920
在这里，德国空军的精英第一次看到了Me-262
It was here that the cream of the German Luftwaffe and saw the Me-262 for the first time.

276
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:50,010
我们第一次看到飞机的时候都震惊了
We were surprised when we first saw it standing there.

277
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,080
机炮简直不可思议
The guns were incredible,

278
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,470
训练这些飞行员成了最优先事项
the training of these pilots was given top priority,

279
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:00,360
但随着战争潮水涌来
But with the tide of war running against them,

280
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,640
已经没有时间进行战术教学了
there was little time for classroom tactics.

281
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,660
训练非常短暂，仅有四个半日的课程
The training was a very simple,four half days of lessons.

282
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,570
然后你就得独自飞行。因为飞机是单座的
Then you had to do your first flight on your own because the machines were single-seaters.

283
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,190
我们必须保证不会弄坏飞机
We had to give our word that we would not damage the machines.

284
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:28,770
否则我们就会受到惩罚或者立即遣送回原岗位
otherwise we would be punished or immediately sent back to the units we came from.

285
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,140
这样的警告牢记在心中，
With that warning uppermost in their minds,

286
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,970
即便是有经验的飞行员，后续训练也被看做是首飞*
even for these experienced pilots, the first flights were always *never again.

287
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:45,180
坐在机翼上的士官向我讲解飞机内部，特别是那些要密切注意的地方
The sergeant who was on the wing explained to me the interior of the plane, especially what to look out for.

288
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,960
例如引擎用的汽油必须缓慢加装
For example, the gas for the engine was only *stepped up very slowly,

289
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,400
否则引擎就会熄火
otherwise the engine would stall.

290
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,460
涡轮引擎必须缓慢变速
The turbine engine had to get used to the speed very slowly,

291
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:00,780
所以必须非常小心
So one had to be very careful.

292
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:13,350
一旦起飞，Me-262将会超越飞行员的期望
Once in the air the experience of flying Me-262 surpassed all their expectations.

293
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:18,090
对任何狂热的飞行员来说，驾驶这架飞机都是最为非凡的体验
For any pilot passionate about flying. It was a most extraordinary experience,

294
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:22,050
特别是咆哮的引擎不在你身前
Especially so because the roaring engine was not in front of your nose.

295
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:23,430
所有噪音都在你身后
All the noise was behind you.

296
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,230
多好的飞机
It is a wonderful thing.

297
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,010
飞机的速度极快
The speed was really enormous.

298
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,580
飞行特性的优势极大
And the flying characteristics were so advantageous.

299
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,720
你坐在飞机里，顿生自信
You actually had a sense of confidence in that machine.

300
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,560
虽然德国飞行员对起飞和速度赞不绝口
Although the German pilots would praise the takeoff and speed at the plane,

301
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:49,020
但降落比较麻烦
It was the landing that gave them problems.

302
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,860
在He109上，飞行员可以关闭引擎缓慢滑行降落
In a 109 plane, one could just switch off the engine and drift done slowly.

303
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,260
但在262上绝无可能
But in this plane it wasn't possible at all.

304
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,800
我以400至500英里每小时的速度飞行，而且无法减速
I was traveling at a speed of four hundred and five hundred miles per hour and couldn't reduce it.

305
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,410
这飞机就是不下降
The plane just wouldn't descend.

306
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:16,350
我看着高度计绕圈飞行，直到3000英尺时才请求降落
I looked at the altitude meter and had to fly in circles until I finally reached an altitude of three thousand feet then asked for permission to land,

307
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:19,590
我放下起落架，慢慢接近跑道
I lowered the landing gear and slowly approached the runway.

308
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,192
最终我安全降落，如释重负
Finally, I was able to land safely and was greatly relieved.

309
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:30,060
和往常降落不同，这次我汗流浃背
In contrast to my usual take off in landings, it was completely soaked with sweat.

310
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,460
最初计划是只有王牌飞行员才能驾驶Me-262
Initially, it was planned that only fighter aces would fly the plane,

311
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:42,390
但4年的战争让帝国空军精锐尽损
But four years of war had taken its toll on Luftwaffe's finest,

312
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:48,090
那些只有10小时飞行经验的普通飞行员也被征召入伍
So regular pilots, some with as little as ten hours' flying experience were drafted in.

313
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:53,370
对于新手来说，驾驶Me-262并不简单
But for inexperienced pilots, the EMe-262 was not an easy plan to fly,

314
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:56,910
超过200名飞行员死于训练
And over two hundred pilots were killed in training alone.

315
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:03,810
显然，最初的那批人，包括我在内
of course, the first ones to whom I count myself as well.

316
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:04,590
我们是最好的飞行员
We were the best.

317
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,940
但那些后来者基本都是新手，无法操控这种飞机
But those who followed us were often at the beginning of their pilot training and didn't cope with the machine.

318
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,810
让他们来驾驶喷气机是完全不负责任的
To put those people in the jet was totally irresponsible.

319
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,560
我们损失惨重
We had huge losses there.

320
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:28,162
1944年中，那些在训练中存活下来的飞行员被送往一个新组建的中队
By mid 1944, those pilots that had survived the training was sent to a newly formed squadrons.

321
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:33,900
草率地组建成的地勤团队来维护这些精妙的武器
Ground crews too, were hastily recruited to service and maintain these new wonder weapons.

322
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:46,410
通常来说，地勤人员努力工作 确保飞机一直处于就绪状态
Generally speaking, my experience was that the ground crew tried very hard to ensure that the planes were always ready for takeoff.

323
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:55,980
我对他们不够了解，因为我总是要准备行动或是等待紧急任务
I did not get to know them well enough because I've always had to be ready for action and was waiting for an emergency takeoff.

324
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:01,380
有时则完全没有任务
Sometimes that was not happen at all.

325
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:07,110
所以说人的半生都在等待中度过
Hence the saying half of one's life *will waits in vain.

326
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,810
然而等待是短暂的
Yet the waiting was short lived,

327
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:24,480
随着数千架轰炸机重创德国，
With thousands of bombers now pounding Germany,

328
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:26,790
每名可用的飞行员都投入行动中
Every available pilots was thrown into action.

329
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,900
1944年7月25日
on July the 25th 1944,

330
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:01,320
一架Me-262成为首架用于实战的喷气战斗机，
它击落了一架飞过慕尼黑正在拍照的英国蚊式侦察机 
An Me-262 became the first jet airplane to be used in combat when it shot down a British photo reconnaissance mosquito flying over Munich.

331
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,280
看来德国赢得了喷气战斗机的竞赛
It now appeared that the race for the jet fighter had been won

332
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,780
*
And with it the prize of victory in the skies, which was now within the Luftwaffe *scruff.

333
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:24,960
1944年夏末，更多的德军飞行员驾驶新Me-262参战
During the late summer of 1944, more and more German Luftwaffe pilots were taking their new Me-262 jet fighters into battle.

334
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:30,570
似乎德军终于找到了可以击败盟军轰炸机和高速护航战斗机的武器
It seemed as though finally they now had a weapon that could beat the Allied bombers and their high speed escorts.

335
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,850
两组四架野马组成紧密队形
There were two groups of four mustangs in close formation,

336
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:45,300
他们非常自信。但他们没有看见我，这是个失误
And they were so incredibly confident. they hadn't seen me, and that was a mistake.

337
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:51,060
我为那些没有注意我的人感到遗憾
I actually felt sorry for the guys is they hadn't noticed me.

338
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,920
我从右侧低处飞向那里。
I came from deep, low, right and flew in there.

339
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,870
 飞机有4门30mm MK108机炮，火力极强
We had four thirty millimeter guns the MK108,that was an incredible fire,

340
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:06,330
长长的机翼目标都展现在我面前，不可能打偏
Because the whole thing presented itself to me was a long outstretched point. You couldn't actually miss.

341
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,000
之后就打下了两架战斗机
And then two fighters dropped down.

342
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,700
我看到其中一架飞行员跳伞，另一架则没有
With one I saw a parachute travel with the other one. I didn't.

343
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,640
情况就是这样
That was such a case.

344
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,420
1944年末，Me262对盟军轰炸机造成了毁灭性的打击
by late 1944 the 262s were attacking the Allied bombers with devastating effect,

345
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:31,080
盟军战斗机和轰炸机组不知道如何处理它们
Allied fighter and bomber crews were unsure how to deal with them.

346
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,500
它们的速度和火力都过于完美了
Their speed and firepower were just too perfect.

347
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,400
我们一枪也打不中，然后它们就飞走了
We couldn't get a shot. And then he goes.

348
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,860
咻~ 再见了您呐~
 Shh~ bye bye fellows~

349
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,500
*
And I just said the *grass the crew we just saw a real pilot.

350
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:03,750
*我们头顶飞过一架Me-262，但只是瞥见了一眼
他从3点钟方向攻击并冲过机群
We were jumped by an Me-262 and only got a very short glimpse of him because he made an attack from about three o'clock high and he came down through the group.

351
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,410
他飞得太快，很难看清楚
He went by so fast, we couldn't hardly see him.

352
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,600
这着实令人震惊，因为从未见过这样的飞机
It was really shocked because it was like nothing that we'd seen before.

353
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,020
战争早期，德国飞行员还没有体会到自己拥有这样的空中霸权
The German pilots had not felt such supremacy in the air since the early days of the war.

354
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:25,560
不过他们坚信这种不可思议的飞机可以扭转局势
They felt sure that this incredible plane would turn the tide.

355
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:31,200
我在德累斯顿区域飞行，下降到16000英尺(4876.8米)
I flew to the area around Dresden and went down to 16,000 feet.

356
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:35,370
我看见两架战斗机在我上方
I spotted two fighter planes, as they were above me,

357
00:30:35,371 --> 00:30:40,590
我拉升高度，将一架敌机纳入视野
I increased my altitude and I took one of the fighter planes in my sights.

358
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:43,860
当时，机枪和机炮都是自动开启的
In those days, the machine guns and cannons were automatically switched on.

359
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,680
四门机炮喷出一串火舌
I had four cannons and I gave off a burst of fire.

360
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,685
*在我意识到命中之前，敌机飞行员就跳伞了
And before I knew it, the pilot parachuted out of his plane.

361
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,740
我甚至都不知道打中了哪里
Where I had hit him I did not know.

362
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,670
一切都是全新的，我就感觉到快
It was all very new, much too fast.

363
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,630
突然我看到了第二架敌机在我前方
And then suddenly I saw the second fighter plane in front of me.

364
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,300
我向他开火
And I fired at it,

365
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,990
他被旗帜一样的烟雾包围着坠落
and it went down, surrounded by smoke that looked like a flag.

366
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,190
但轰炸机才是Me-262的首要猎物
But it was the bombers that were the Me-262's real prey.

367
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:27,330
德军飞行员艾尔弗雷德在执行他的第13次任务
一次例行巡逻中碰见了B-17轰炸机
Luftwaffe pilot, Alfred Arms was on a routine patrol when he came across a B-17 on its 13th mission.

368
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:35,820
没有过多讨论，每个人就选定了目标
Everyone quickly chose a plane without having any great discussions about whether they were going to take this or the other plane.

369
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:39,510
替代讨论的办法是：说明自己最佳的进攻位置
Instead, you would say the best position for me is the one in the middle.

370
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:43,470
空中有很多敌机，因此很容易就能选择一个目标
There were enough planes in the sky, which made it easy to pick one.

371
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,130
在那架B-17上的后射手正是19岁的克雷格
The rear gunner in that particular B-17 was nineteen year old Craig Bennett.

372
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,140
他太快了
He came so fast.

373
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:56,640
你只能扣动扳机，立马开火
all you had time was just pull the triggers and let the guns fire.

374
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,920
我瞄准了突然出现在前方的B-17（绰号：“飞行堡垒”）
I was aiming at a fortress when suddenly ahead of me,

375
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:14,850
*中队队长被卷入巨大的火墙中，其他人也消失了
There was a large wall of fire into which the captain of my squadron and others disappeared.

376
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,220
第一架飞机是领队，他袭击了我们的飞机
The first plane was the leader and he hit our plane.

377
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,390
飞机就这样爆炸了
The plane just blew up.

378
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,210
*
The whole *plane exploded his plane and ours. 

379
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:34,920
我得以从火墙上飞过
I was able to fly over the wall of fire.

380
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:41,220
原来，B-17爆炸会让附近范围都处在火焰中
It turned out that the fortress had exploded and taken to adjacent flames with that.

381
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,530
这就是B-17爆炸的威力
That's how big the explosion was.

382
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,370
机尾开始碎裂
And the tail broke off.

383
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,490
飞机开始坠落
and started falling.

384
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,550
其余的机体都消失了
And the rest of the plane was gone.

385
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,620
*
I was the only one they'd *gather my aircraft.

386
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,040
克雷格在接下来的战争期间成为俘虏
Craig Bennett was to spend the rest of the war a POWs.

387
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,640
但这并不是一边倒的战斗
Yet it was not all a one-sided fight.

388
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:14,280
对这些神奇武器感到震惊的同时,
Once they got over the shock of these new wonder weapons,

389
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:18,600
盟军飞行员开始逐渐掌握对付德军喷气机的办法
the Allied pilots slowly began to learn how to deal with the German jet.

390
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:22,381
首要的问题就是如何克服速度上的巨大劣势
The first problem was how to overcome the huge speed disadvantage.

391
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:26,220
飞行员发现当野马战斗机进入垂直俯冲状态，
The pilot's found that when they put the Mustang into a steep dive,

392
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,770
他们就能和Me-262有相同的速度
their speed was the same as the Me-262.

393
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,760
因此我把油门推到底
So I just bent the throttle as far as it could forward,

394
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,350
*一刻不停
*without going through the stop.

395
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,090
接下来
And?

396
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:44,610
因为他在做一点转向，所以能非常缓慢地接近他
Slowly, very, very slowly start *gaining along the guy because he was making a little turn.

397
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:46,710
每当他转向一点，我就能逐渐接近
And each time you turn a little bit, I get a little closer.

398
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,760
这家伙是个新手
this guy was inexperienced.

399
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:59,250
我很确信，因为他看见第一架敌机时既没有飞过去也没有出手攻击
*I'm sure because when he saw the first tracers,either *go by him or hit his airplane.

400
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:00,660
而是开始转向
He made a turn.

401
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:03,300
如果他把机头朝下，我们怎么才能逃走呢
If you to put his nose down, how do we run?

402
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:04,080
我们可能就被击落了
We probably never got.

403
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,020
这是一段敌机进入我方射程的影片
A movie where we got in range.

404
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:16,200
盟军飞行员也发现Me-262的机动能力不如螺旋桨飞机
The Allied pilots also found that the Me-262 did not respond as quick in a turn as propeller planes.

405
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,870
这个影响是致命的
This would have deadly consequences.

406
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:29,040
我位于他转向圈的内侧时，就可以像打靶一样射击它的头部
I was on the inside of his circle and I was able to get a bead on him and shoot in front of him,

407
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,960
这样他就会自己撞上子弹
so he would fly into the bullets.

408
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,070
但Me-262最脆弱的还是起飞和降落的时候
But it was on takeoff and landing at the Me-262, with at its most vulnerable.

409
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,600
盟军飞行员埋伏在机场附近
Allied pilots lay in wait around the airfields.

410
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:49,380
上百名Me-262飞行员死于这种袭击方式
Hundreds of 262 pilots were to dine In this way.

411
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,390
美国人改变策略，专注于驻扎喷气机的机场
The Americans change their tactics to concentrate on all airfields, where jet fighter units were stationed.

412
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,760
这样他们就能在我们最脆弱的时候发动袭击
This way they were able to hit us when we were most vulnerable.

413
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:06,540
——起飞和降落的时候
During startup and landing.

414
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,300
在起飞的时候，我们速度不足
During takeoff, we did not have enough speed.

415
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,830
降落时，我们需要减速
And when landing, we had to reduce it.

416
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,150
这就是问题所在
That was the problem.

417
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,130
随着战争天平向盟军倾斜
With the tide of war turning against them,

418
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:30,270
Me-262的空中优势荡然无存
the Me-262 superiority in the skies was over.

419
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:38,190
更多的飞机被击落，恐惧一直萦绕在飞行员心头
More and more planes were being shot down and fear was ever-present in the remaining pilots minds.

420
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:43,290
*战争后期，飞行员才发现
The thoughts would only enter your head at a later stage when within the squadron,

421
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:47,100
中队里三分之一至四分之一的队员，每周就更换一批
nearly every third or fourth person had to be replaced every week.

422
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,270
战争持续越久，这种情况就越多
The longer the war lasted, the more this occurred.

423
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,640
我认为这导致了战争的结束
I believe this led to the end of the war.

424
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,870
愤怒于德军高层糟蹋喷气中队的行为
Furious that the new jet squadrons were being wasted by the German High Command,

425
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:07,320
在加兰德将军和其他著名王牌飞行员的坚持下
and under insistence of General Galland and other famous aces,

426
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:12,720
元首勉强同意1/20的Me-262生产战斗机型号
Hitler reluctantly allowed every twentieth Me-262 to be built as a fighter.

427
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,490
这种做法完全错误
It was a completely wrong thing to do.

428
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,750
有些轰炸机被当作夜间战斗机使用
And some of the bombers were used as night fighters.

429
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,940
他们完全误判了局势
“they had totally misjudge the situation.

430
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,450
我只能假设他们执着于自己的错觉
I can only assume that they were following their own delusion.

431
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:36,780
领导人的命令在1944年末终于被撤销
*The order of the leader was at last rescinded in late 1944.

432
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:41,550
元首终于下令所有Me-262都作为战斗机型号生产
Hitler finally ordered that all Me-262s should now be built as fighters.

433
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,710
随着盟军进军德国本土，这么做还来得及吗？
With the allies marching into Germany, was it too late?

434
00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:00,030
1945年初，几乎所有Me-262工厂被盟军摧毁
By early 1945, and with nearly all her factories destroyed by the Allies,

435
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:05,190
德国人发现几乎无法生产急需的喷气战斗机
Germany was finding it almost impossible to produce the jet fighters so desperately needed.

436
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,110
因此提出了一个新办法
So a novel solution was brought about.

437
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,510
轰炸确实减缓了生产
The bombing did slow everything down.

438
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:19,500
但如果我们有足够的材料，就能生产出所需数量的战机
But if we had enough material, we could have manufactured the required numbers.

439
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:21,570
*
*let's say 43 or 40.

440
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:27,087
最后我们都习惯了
In the end, we got used to it.

441
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:28,860
更多人进入森林more went into the woods,

442
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,420
我们在那搭起大型掩体和伪装帐篷
where we put up large shelters, camouflages *tents.

443
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,870
工厂遍及德国各地，Me-262的零件在夜色掩护下通过卡车、马车
Manufacturer throughout Germany, Sections of the Me-262 were then delivered under cover of darkness by truck, horse and cart,

444
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:46,710
甚至是自行车运输，然后再森林中组装起来
and even bicycles to be fully assembled in forests.

445
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,050
超过800架是通过这种方式组装起来的
Over eight hundred were to be built in this way.

446
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,240
当越来越多的Me-262被盟军战斗机击落，
But as more and more Me-262 were being destroyed by allied fighters,

447
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,970
德国空军的精英也越来越少
so too with the cream of the German Luftwaffe.

448
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,530
有一天，一架飞机*和我飞机上方碰撞，我的飞机起火了
One day a plane came crashing down above me and my plane caught fire.

449
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,460
我只能跳伞
I had to bail out.

450
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,550
这次我只能用降落伞落地了
That's how I had to land with my parachute.

451
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,610
对我来说，战争结束了
And that was the end of the war for me.

452
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,480
突然一声巨响
There was suddenly a big bang.

453
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,100
*短暂停顿后，我没有像往常那样回头看
*or a couple of brief moments, I did not look back as I would usually do.

454
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,990
而是望向天空，看看发生了什么
I was looking in the sky to see what had happened.

455
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,560
某处发出一阵闪光
There was a flash somewhere.

456
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,740
之后我就发现引擎起火
And then I saw the engine. what was catching fire.

457
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,690
那时，我位于云层上空4000英尺(1219.2米)
At that stage, I was about four thousand feet above the layer of cloud.

458
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,550
一看到起火，我立即俯冲进云层
Upon seeing the fire, I immediately dived into the clouds,

459
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:48,630
我改变航向，向左飞行以避开火焰
I changed course and turned left in order to get out of the line of fire.

460
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,430
我想跳伞逃生
I wanted to jump up with a parachute.

461
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,580
接着我想起有人和我说，如果你十分恐惧，想要跳伞
Then I remembered that someone had once told me that if you are too frightened to jump off,

462
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:01,620
把控制杆推向一边
then push the joystick to the side,

463
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:06,810
用脚支撑自己，然后把自己推出去
Stand on it with your foot and push yourself off.

464
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,190
这就是我做的事
That's what I did.

465
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,350
战争快结束的时候
Towards the end of the war,

466
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:23,310
根本没有足够受过训练的飞行员来驾驶喷气战斗机
There simply were not enough trained pilots to fly the jet fighter.

467
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:28,080
*现有的Me-262生产也停滞不前
Even if there had been the production of the Me-262, had ground to a halt,

468
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:32,760
他们无法生产足够的喷气战斗机来阻止潮水般涌入的盟军
They simply could not build enough jet fighters to stem the tide of the conquering allies.

469
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,620
德国最终在1945年5月7日投降
Germany finally surrendered on May, the 7th 1945.

470
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,300
当城市和工厂都被摧毁
As cities and factories were totally smashed,

471
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,560
同样，喷气战斗机工业也被破坏了
So too, with the jet aircraft industry.

472
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,430
接下来的几个月里
In the following months,

473
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:59,628
*英美苏为这架分散在德国各处的神奇飞机的遗产争执不休
Britain, America and Russia squabbled over the carcasses of the wonder jets that were scattered throughout Germany

474
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:04,140
*对飞机进行彻底研究之后，他们都开始建立自己的喷气机工业
and picking through the bones, they began to build their own jet aircraft industries.

475
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,330
在一个叫Lusty(德国空军技术)的行动中
In an operation called operation Lusty (LUftwaffe Secret TechnologY)

476
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:11,340
通过沃森上校的命令
Under the command of colonel Watson,

477
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:14,340
美国人收集了所有他们能找到的德国飞机
the Americans gathered all the German planes they could find.

478
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,240
它们被空运到法国瑟堡，之后被船运回美国进行评估
They were flown to Cherbourg in France and then shipped to America for revaluation.

479
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:33,450
沃森的团队由一群美国飞行员组成，
他们负责夺取德国飞行器并送往法国海岸，
最终送回美国做进一步分析
Watson's *wizards were a group of American pilots tasked with capturing flying German aircraft to the French coast and bringing them back to the United States for testing and evaluation,

480
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:39,990
他们有义务将这个最新技术带回美国，因此要和英国苏联竞争
The commitment to getting this new technology back to the United States, and they were actually racing against the British and the Soviets.

481
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:47,520
这样做可以确保美国在战后的航空优势
To do this would ensure that America would have an aeronautical superiority in the postwar period,

482
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,020
美国人对Me-262做了大量的测试
The Americans began an extensive testing program of the Me-262.

483
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,610
通过对这架德国战斗机喷气引擎和气动设计的分析，
By analyzing the jet turbines and wind design at this German fighter,

484
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:59,190
美国人就可以生产自己设计的机型了
They were able to produce their own design,

485
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:02,010
这就是后来性能极佳的F-86佩刀战斗机
which was to become the fabulous F-86 Sabre.

486
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:10,014
直到通过lusty行动和其他项目获取德国喷气技术后，
It's not until the German jet technology that's brought over through operation lusty and other programs

487
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:21,210
飞机制造商例如
that aircraft like North American F-86 with its swept-wing especially reflect the German technology and the way to design a proper and efficient jet airplane.

488
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,110
苏联也发现了Me-262的秘密
The Russians also dealt into the Me-262 secrets,

489
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:32,670
在英国喷气技术的帮助下，设计出了米格15
And with the help of British jet's technology would later build then MIG-15.

490
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:39,630
事实上，苏联工业的飞跃靠的是二战末期从德国人那里拿来的技术
Really, the boost for the Russian engineering industry was what they captured from the Germans at the end of the Second World War.

491
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,720
苏联航空工业的发展关键是得到了我们的最新引擎
The main thing, though, really for the Russian aircraft industry was when we gave them our latest engine

492
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:52,200
这让米格15从设计还不错的飞机一跃成为世界级飞机
and that allowed to MIG-15 to go from being an average aircraft with good design to a world beater.

493
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,320
和Me-262一起到美国的还有它的设计者奥海恩
Along with the Me-262’s moved to America when designer Hans von Ohain,

494
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:02,400
他后来成为美国空军航空推进技术的首席科学家
he was to become the chief scientist of aero Propulsion for the United States Air Force.

495
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,060
弗兰克·惠特尔最后也来到了美国
Frank Whittle eventually moved to America,

496
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:10,200
他成为了几个航空项目的顾问
where he became a consultant on several aviation projects.

497
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:11,280
威利·梅塞施密特
Wilhelm Messerschmitt

498
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:17,490
Me-262之父，留在德国帮助重建支离破碎的航空工业
The father of the Me-262 remained in Germany and helps in rebuilding their shattered aircraft industry.

499
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:24,180
大量的盟军飞机成为了Me-262的受害者
Hundreds of Allied aircraft were to fall victim to the Me-262.

500
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:26,190
但是代价也非常沉重
But at a terrible price,

501
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:30,660
生产的1400架Me-262中，没有几架能在战争中幸存
hardly any of the 1400 Me-262s that were built survived the war.

502
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:38,460
仍然有很多人相信，如果Me-262再点服役
Yet many people still believe that if the Me-262 had entered service earlier,

503
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:40,590
它或许能使德国免于战败
it could have save Germany from defeat.

504
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:49,470
有很多假设，例如提早半年引进这项计划
There has been a lot of speculation and perhaps if they could have introduced the whole program half a year earlier.

505
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:58,410
*但话说回来，这会被用于战争吗?只有天知道
But if you are truthfully, would it have decided to war? Only the gods know.

506
