1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,660
1944年中期 
By the middle of 1944

2
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,800
盟军投入1000架轰炸机
Allied forces were regularly flying raids of 1,000 bombers over Nazi Germany,

3
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,410
在P51野马等远航程战斗机护航下对纳粹德国定期轰炸
Escorted by powerful, long range sightings like the P51 Mustang

4
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:38,850
德国空军无力抵抗这庞大的空中舰队
the German Luftwaffe could put up little resistance to these vast air armadas 

5
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,820
但是在1944年7月
But in July 1944

6
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:46,170
一种新式德国战斗机出现在天空中
a new German fighter appeared in the skies,

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,250
其飞行时速比野马高出100多英里
capable of flying over one hundred miles per hour faster than the Mustang,

8
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,980
并且装备了4门30mm口径的机炮
and armed with four thirty millimeter cannons.

9
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:57,000
可以摆脱护航战斗机并一次性将轰炸机全部摧毁
It could outmaneuver the escorts and destroy a bomber in a single pass. 

10
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,180
德军的新战机
The new German fighter,

11
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:05,400
这种让盟军飞行员恐惧，并且让德国空军认为自己不可战胜的
which put fear into the allied pilots and made the German Luftwaffe feeling invincible.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,540
正是喷气式的梅塞施密特262
Was the jet propelled Messerschmitt 262

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,380
我第一次看见德国的喷气机Me262时，
The first time I saw a German jet, the Me262

14
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,370
我简直不敢相信 它跑的这么快
I could hardly believe it how fast it was.

15
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,180
*听不清


16
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,700
这次我们不再是猎物，而是猎人
At this time we were again not the hunted,but the hunters.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,380
*所以我们现在有信心取胜
So now we won with a ego.

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,160
使用出色的影像档案和*色彩再现，
Using extraordinary archive film and color re-enactments,

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,570
《Battle Stations》节目将会深入速度之争，探索航空史上第一种投入实战的喷气战斗机
Battle stations dives into the high speed world of the race to get the first jet fighter ever to fly in combat.

20
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,240
梅塞施密特262 : 喷气竞赛
Messerschmitt 262：RACE FOR THE JET

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,380
讽刺的是，令盟军恐惧的Me262的起源是一张和平条约
Ironically, the origins of the fearsome Messerschmitt 262 were born out of a peace treaty.

22
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,450
在一战战败后
Following its defeat in World War One,

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,020
德国被同盟国强制签署禁止发展常规飞行技术的协定，
Germany was forced by the allies to sign an agreement which banned them from developing further conventional aircraft technologies,

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,540
然而其中并未提及火箭和喷气推进技术。
that rockets and jet propulsion would never mentioned.

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,400
1930年，
in the 1930s

26
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:12,150
元首开始描绘纳粹德国的蓝图
Adolf Hitler began to build his vision for Nazi Germany.

27
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,630
其中包括世界最强的空军
That vision included the most powerful air force in the world.

28
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,480
为达到这一目标，空军必须有高航速
To achieve this, the airforce must have speed.

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,280
当时，
At that time,

30
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,310
人们认识到，飞得更快意味着需要飞的更高
It was realized that to fly faster meant flying higher,

31
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,900
因为高处空气更稀薄
where the air is thinner.

32
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,730
但当飞行高度增加，
but the higher a plane flies,

33
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:32,490
螺旋桨就更难牵引飞机前进
the harder it is for a propeller to draw it through the air.

34
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,850
在德国哥廷根大学，一位年轻的工程师 汉斯·冯·奥海恩开始了涡轮喷气引擎的研究
At the German University of Göttingen a young engineer named Hans von Ohain began development work on a turbo jet engine.

35
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,460
汉斯·冯·奥海恩是个十分优秀的学生，
他第一次完成喷气引擎的构想时仅有21岁
A brilliant student Hans von Ohain was only twenty one years old when he first conceived the idea of a jet engine.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,590
There's one.

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,570
他是个好学的技术人员
He was a technician with an inquisitive mind.

38
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:03,180
他非常擅长解决理论问题
He was very good at theoretical problems,

39
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:04,560
而且他也在学习物理
and he studied physics as well.

40
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,370
If you tried it.

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,210
受到他教授的鼓舞，
Encouraged by his professor,

42
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,880
这位年轻工程师开始着手制造原型
the young engineer began to build a working prototype.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,270
此时的英国，
Meanwhile, in Britain,

44
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:21,300
全然不知德国发生的事，26岁的皇家空军飞行员弗兰克·惠特尔
totally unaware of what was happening in Germany,a 26 year old Royal Air Force pilots named Frank Whittle,

45
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,030
正在研发一种燃气涡轮引擎
was developing a gas turbine engine.

46
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,050
1932年
in 1932

47
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,660
他提交了世界上第一份喷气引擎的专利
He filed a patent on the world's first jet engine.

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,960
在这个早期片段中
In this early film,

49
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,440
弗兰克·惠特尔亲自解释了引擎的原理
Frank Whittle himself explains the principles of his engine.

50
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,420
这代表一个离心压缩机
This represents a centrifugal type compressor.

51
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:45,210
用这个在前端吸入空气，像这样压缩进入燃烧室
I use this to pull in air at the front and to compress it into combustion chambers like this,

52
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:53,100
这里会注入燃料并燃烧，使空气膨胀，让它有足够的能量驱动压缩机的涡轮
where the injection of burning the fuel ** and expand the air and gives it enough energy to drive a turbine which drives the compressor.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
这个设计将会成为世界上第一个完全可行的喷气引擎
This design was to become the world's first fully working jet engine.

54
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,280
但惠特尔发现很难让英国军方重视他的设计
But Whittle found it difficult to get his design taken seriously by the British military establishment.

55
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,400
当时科学家，即当权者的建议是这个设计不可行
The scientific advice at that time and i.e by the people in power was it couldn't work.

56
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,860
让它正常工作需要过多的能量
It required just too much power to make it work.

57
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:17,010
军方人员听取了这个建议
And the officials at the ministry listened to that advice,

58
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:27,210
*惠特尔被视作妄想用当时无法实现的想法一举成名的人
and Whittle was very much seen as a bit of an upstart that was trying to sort of make his name and push forward an idea that was not really achievable at that time. 

59
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:32,910
对惠特尔的阻碍导致的延期，之后将成为德国喷气引擎研究的显著优势
The delays, which were to hamper Whittle were to prove a distinct advantage for German jet engine development.

60
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,540
1935年
By 1935

61
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:45,330
汉斯在导师建议下，通过飞机制造商亨克尔的经济支持完成了测试引擎
Hans von Ohain had developed a test engine on the advice of his professor approach the aircraft manufacturer Ernst Hanckel for financial support.

62
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,200
亨克尔作为激进理念的赞助者而出名
Hanckel was known as a patron of radical concepts,

63
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:54,840
他特别看重那些能提高速度，让他能建造世界最快飞机的技术
especially those which would lead to higher speeds and enable him to build the fastest airplane in the world.

64
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,540
亨克尔对此印象深刻
他意识到这种引擎的巨大潜力，要求制造全尺寸型号
 Impressed, Heinkel recognize the enormous potential of such an engine and ordered the construction of a fullscale *power plant.

65
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:12,990
汉斯和他的工程师团队接受了任务，
开始研发亨克尔HeS 3引擎
Ohain and his team of engineers accepted the task and set to work on what would become the HES 3 jet engine.

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
回到英国，
Back in Britain,

67
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:21,900
惠特尔终于筹到了开一间小公司的钱
Whittle had finally managed to raise enough funds to establish a small company.

68
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,270
公司建立在莱斯特郡的拉特沃思小镇
Located in the little Leicestershire town of Lutterworth,

69
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:29,100
他将其命名为Power Jets
he called it powered jets.

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,950
1937年
In 1937,

71
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,750
他第一次测试引擎
he tested his engine for the first time.

72
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:44,430
惠特尔遇到了各种问题*
Whittle had all sorts of problems when the engine on pairing up ran away with itself and just kept going and going the thrust built up,

73
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:49,020
惠特尔就站在那看着机器爆炸，因为他已经被吓坏了
and Whittle just stood there and waited for it to go bang because he was just transfixed by it.

74
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,300
但同时他也被这个情景所吸引
He also was enthralled by what was happening.

75
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,710
这台机器是他的孩子
This was his baby,

76
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:54,750
惠特尔不想让它破裂
and he didn't want it to break fall apart.

77
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:55,830
他正在悉心照顾这台机器
He was looking after it.

78
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:58,710
即便其他所有人都明智地立马跑路了
Although everyone else sensibly left the area very quickly.

79
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,990
尽管有许多挫折与失败
Despite many setbacks and failures,

80
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:13,470
惠特尼最终掌控了他的引擎
which will finally succeeded in controlling his engine.

81
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:15,900
但是英国政府仍未被说服
but the British government was still not convinced,

82
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,200
政府更倾向传统的飞机和引擎设计
preferring instead conventional designs for aircraft and engines.

83
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,440
惠特尔的发明在整个30年代面临重重阻力
Whittle face resistance to his invention throughout the 1930s.

84
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:30,540
先前的喷气推进测试表明涡桨飞机将会很重，
Previous experiments with jet propulsion indicated that turboprops will be heavy,

85
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,690
昂贵且不可靠
expensive and very unreliable.

86
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:37,380
英国航空部和皇家空军认为
The British Air Ministry and the Royal aircraft establishment saw,

87
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:44,550
喷气推进要想成为飞机动力的可行替代方案，至少还有10至15年的路要走
that turbo jets were not going to be a viable alternative for Aero propulsion until ten or fifteen years down the road.

88
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,220
与此同时
Throughout this time,

89
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:51,090
惠特尔并不知道德国人也在研发喷气引擎
Frank Whittle did not know that the Germans were developing a jet engine.

90
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:53,970
项目的保密非常完善
So good was the secrecy surrounding the project.

91
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:58,230
研发内容从不为人所知
Little was known about what was being developed at all 

92
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:05,250
当时，惠特尔35年的专利被发布在德国的技术杂志上
Whittle's patents, which were released in 35 and were published in Germany in German in the technical magazines at that time,

93
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,830
汉斯得知了这一切
made available to * von Ohain,

94
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:12,120
惠特尔已经注册了很多专利
a lot of material Whittle it previously had as a patent,

95
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:16,860
可以这么说，汉斯已经在阅读这些内容
and now I think it would be fair to say at that time that von Ohain would have gone down the road of reading these,

96
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:17,940
他不会抄袭
he wouldn't have copied it,

97
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,390
但他一定会阅读并且运用到他自己的领域中
but he would certainly have read it and interpreted it into the zones he was involved in.

98
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,490
当战争阴云开始笼罩
As the clouds of war gathered on the horizon,

99
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,120
纳粹政权对开发高速的推进技术更为执着
the Nazi regime had become more determined than ever to develop faster forms of propulsion for its *lift off.

100
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,610
1938年
in 1938,

101
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:42,960
帝国航空部签发了德国航空工业规范
the Reich Air Ministry issued a specification to the German aviation industry.

102
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,230
一种单座喷气战斗机
A single seat turbo jet fighter.

103
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,250
被这道命令所推动
Spurred on by this directive,

104
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,110
亨克尔的团队推行这项计划
Heinkel's team pushed ahead,

105
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:55,380
设计一型装备奥海恩引擎的战机
designing an aircraft to be powered by Ohain's jet engines.

106
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,660
得益于绘图板上的两兄弟
From the drawing boards of twin brothers, Siegfried and Walter Gunter,

107
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:04,410
第一款实用型喷气动力飞机即将起飞
the first practical jet powered aircraft was to take flight.

108
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:06,840
命名为He-178
It was called the He-178.

109
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,020
1939年8月27日
On August the 27th 1939

110
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,960
在二战爆发前一周
one week before the outbreak of World War II,

111
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,510
小巧的He-178升空
the little Heinkel 178 took to the air.

112
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,780
德国人在喷气引擎竞赛中先行一步
The Germans had succeeded in being first in getting a jet air war.

113
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,830
但第一架喷气战斗机的竞赛才刚刚开始
But the race for the first jet fighter had only just begun.

114
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,840
1939年9月3日
On September the 3rd 1939,

115
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,120
二战开始
the Second World War began,

116
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,290
在接下来的几周时间里
and over the next few weeks,

117
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,200
德国人扫清了他们面前的一切
Germany swept all before them.

118
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,980
亨克尔和汉斯对喷气飞机的世界首飞兴奋不已，
Flushed with the success of having just flown the world's first jet aircraft,

119
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:59,560
*两个月后，他们可以向纳粹政府展示飞机了
It was two months before Ernst Heinkel and Hans von Ohain were able to demonstrate their plane to the Nazi government.

120
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,100
但随着纳粹军队所向披靡，传统空军主宰天空
But with its army conquering all and with its conventional airforce becoming masters of the skies,

121
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,920
德国人突然对喷气动力失去了兴趣
the Germans had suddenly lost interest in jet power.

122
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,850
He-178短暂而荣耀的一生结束，余生注定在柏林博物馆度过
The He-178 short but glorious life was over and was destined to spend the rest of his days in a Berlin museum.

123
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:31,300
但有坚定信念的人仍在默默地完善他自己的喷气飞机设计
But there were others in Germany who did not believe that the race for the first jet fighter was over quietly working on his own jet aircraft design.

124
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
这就是后来的Me-262
that would become the Me-262

125
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,300
设计者是杰出的41岁航空工程师：威利·梅塞施密特
was a brilliant 41 year old aeronautical engineer called Wilhelm Messerschmitt.

126
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,970
整个三十年代，梅塞施密特都是战斗机和轰炸机设计者和制造商
Throughout the thirties Messerschmitt had been a designer and manufacturer of bombers and fighters,

127
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:47,250
这正是纳粹高层所喜欢的项目
a favorite with the Nazi hierarchy,

128
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,440
他是个工作狂，*让所有共事的人都忠于他 
人们常说他很有艺术才能
he was a workaholic and created loyalty from all that knew him. *It was often he was very artistic.

129
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,820
周末在家时
At home over the course of a weekend,

130
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:00,750
他会在一张A4纸上设计飞机部件
he could design an aircraft part on an a4 sheet of paper,

131
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,350
图纸马上就能投入生产
and then the drawing would be ready to be taken into the workshop right away.

132
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:12,240
他可以完成非常好的设计，而且有着敏锐的直觉
His designs were that good. He was a very intuitive person,

133
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:18,420
但他有时也会大发雷霆
but he would lose his temper a lot.

134
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:23,940
然而这时，德国当局对喷气工业不再感兴趣
Yet whilst the German authorities appeared to have lost interest in their jet industry.

135
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:26,760
在英国，惠特尔终于时来运转
In Britain,Frank Whittles fortunes have changed.

136
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,860
在一系列冗长而沮丧的斗争后
After a long and frustrating battle,

137
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:34,530
英国航空部终于同意投资，并且建造一座工厂用于量产他的喷气引擎
The British Air Ministry finally agreed to finance and build a factory for him to manufacture his jet engine.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,320
验证惠特尔引擎的飞机订单给了格洛斯特航空公司
The Gloucester Aircraft Company was given the contract to produce an experimental plane that would prove Whittle's engines.

139
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:45,030
验证机名称为E.28
It was called the E.28.

140
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,360
最终在1941年5月15日
Finally on May the 15th 1941

141
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,920
在汉斯的He-178首飞20个月后，
20 months after Hans von Ohain He-178 had first flown,

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,490
格洛斯特E.28终于升空
The Gloucester E.28 took to the air.

143
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,280
首飞对于E.28来说意义重大，
The first flight to the E.28 was a significant event,

144
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:10,500
显然这是飞机可行性的最终验证
because obviously this was the final proof of the aircraft's operational use.

145
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,680
惠特尔一举成名
Whittle overnight became the success.

146
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,200
之前普遍认为飞机没有螺旋桨是无法起飞的，
但是他做到了。人们纷纷向他祝贺
He had achieved something that previously people thought wouldn't happen an aircraft flying with no propeller and they were suddenly having him congratulations well done Frank,

147
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,230
然后惠特尔转身解释说：这简直太TM适合飞行了
You know, and Frank were to turn around said well it was bloody well designed to fly.

148
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,570
人们十分振奋，其中包括美国陆军参谋长亨利·哈里·阿诺德
Amongst all this excitement was visiting American Army Chief of Staff General Henry Harley Arnold.

149
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:41,880
他确信这个英国发明可以为美国喷气技术带来很大帮助
He was convinced that this British invention could help to spring board America into the race for the jet.

150
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:50,100
对英国喷气机的飞行感到非常震惊之余
It was very surprised about the fact that the British had a jet engine aircraft flying,

151
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,700
他只能推测德国人的喷气机研发至少也是这个水准
and he can only speculate that the Germans were at least as far in their development of a jet aircraft as well.

152
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,540
怀着对新型喷气技术的热情和让美国海军赶上新技术的决心，
So, enthusiastic about the new jet technology and wanting to emphasize the U. S Navy catch up,

153
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:08,730
阿诺德和英国政府协商，将一个惠特尔引擎的样品带回美国
Arnold negotiated with the British government to bring an example of Whittle's engine to the United States,

154
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,400
这样，美国的喷气机项目就能起步了。
So the American turbojet program could begin.

155
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:20,910
大英首相丘吉尔也很希望美国对于参战的承诺，
因此同意移交惠特尔的喷气引擎
Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill was also eager to get the U. S committed to the British war effort and agreed to hand over whittle's jet designs.

156
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:29,670
丘吉尔的态度是：我们怎么才能把美国拖下水
Churchill's attitude was how can we involve America in our fight against the dictatorships.

157
00:12:29,671 --> 00:12:42,900
*他认为通过赠送最新技术给美国，
可以让美国在之后转向支持英国
And he's seen the the fact that we would give this very latest development of technology to the Americans freely would help them appreciate this sort of problems we were in and later on maybe come down on our side.

158
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,270
惠特尔引擎的部件被迅速安排装箱
Hastily arrangements were made to box up Whittle’s engine parts and plans.

159
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,640
作为顶级机密，这箱宝贵的货物被轰炸机送往华盛顿
Amidst top secrecy, this precious cargo was loaded into a bomber and flown to a *bowling/Boeing? field In Washington, DC.

160
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,310
之后，引擎被送往位于麻省的通用电气公司工厂
It was then transported to the General Electric plants in Massachusetts.

161
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,120
不同于惠特尔的小规模研发
Unlike the small scale of development that Whittle facing in Great Britain,

162
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:17,760
美国人致力于调整和改进他的引擎
the American effort in modifying and improving his engine,

163
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,350
用大尺寸进行研制
United States was on a large scale.

164
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,020
在通用的工厂里
At the General Electric plant,

165
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:31,440
得益于在耐热高强度合金的丰富经验，通用改进了引擎，
最终成果就是GE *IA引擎 
the company used its experience in heat-resistant in a high-strength alloys to modify and improve what would eventually become the general electric *IA engines.

166
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:34,740
我认为这项工作的机密性和重要性再怎么强调也不为过
I cannot overemphasize the secrecy and the importance of this work.

167
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,300
大家都知道意呆利和德国人都在研发喷气技术
We know that both the Italians and the Germans are working on jets.

168
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,370
你们应该都知道一定不能让他们抢占先机
I hardly need to tell you that they must not win the race.

169
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,780
通过授予最高优先权
Given unlimited priority,

170
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:52,560
我们要在6个月内完成第一台机器
we will have the first unit running on task in six months.

171
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,160
与此同时在德国
Meanwhile, in Germany,

172
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,710
尽管纳粹政府对喷气技术漠不关心
Despite Nazi indifference to the jet,

173
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:01,530
亨克尔的团队还是在研发喷气战斗机
Heinkel's team continued to develop a jet fighter.

174
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,580
1941年3月30日
On March the 30th 1941,

175
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:08,070
亨克尔280第一次试飞
the Heinkel 280, had its first test flight.

176
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,620
汉斯洋洋得意地陶醉在这历史性的场景中
Triumphantly, Hans von Ohain was amongst those who reveled in this momentous occasion.

177
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,440
由他设计的引擎驱动，
Powered by his jet engine,

178
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:22,110
试验机设计极佳，速度可以超过每小时500英里
the plane was a superb design capable of speeds in excess of five hundred miles per hour.

179
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,840
领先所有竞争对手一大截
It was light years ahead of all its competitors.

180
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,300
这次测试飞行对亨克尔和汉斯都是巨大的个人成就
The test flight was a huge personal success for Heinkel and von Ohain

181
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:34,050
遗憾的是，*他们的飞机运气不佳
but sadly their jet fighter was not destined to be a winner.

182
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,770
亨克尔的核心问题是没有符合帝国空军部的要求，
因此无法获取合同
（无法找到匹配且可靠的引擎 [译者注]）
At the core of Heinkel's problem with getting contracts for operational jet and rocket aircraft was his inability to play by the rules of the Reich Air Ministry.

183
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:48,930
另一方面，梅塞施密特完全合规，因此获得大量合同
but on the other hand, Messerschmitt was able to play by the rules and was awarded with substantial contracts.

184
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,090
当1941年接近尾声时，
As 1941 drew to a close ,

185
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:57,690
英美德都加入了喷气研究
Britain America and Germany were all committed to jet development.

186
00:14:57,691 --> 00:15:01,380
但对于美国来说 ，另一个事件让这个竞赛更为激烈
But for America another event made the race more intense.

187
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,240
1941年12月7日,
on December the 7th 1941,

188
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,040
日本偷袭珍珠港
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.

189
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,780
美国参战给对抗德国的盟军带来了急需的生命线
America's entry into World War II brought a much-needed lifeline to the allies in the battle against Germany.

190
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,910
全面的喷气机竞赛开始了
The full-blown race for the first jet fighter was now on.

191
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,170
英国政府终于批准惠特尔为战斗机研究喷气引擎
In Britain, the government had finally given the go ahead for Frank to develop a jet engine for a fighter.

192
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,870
美国通用公司恢复了所有暂停的研究
In America, General Electric was pulling out all the stops.

193
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:37,440
他们在6个月内生产引擎的计划进展顺利
Their promise to produce an engine within six months was on target.

194
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,660
同时在德国
And in Germany,

195
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:47,850
元首认为Me262是优秀的武器，要求梅塞施密特*提前投入量产
Hitler now saw the Me-262 as a wonder weapon and pushed Messerschmitt for an early completion to get the plane into production.

196
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:54,150
他们要我们继续研发，并批准梅塞施密特的一切提案
Do you wonder they wanted us to get a move on and granted permission to any of Messerschmitt's proposals.

197
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,030
德国喷气机工业正全速前进
The German jet aircraft industry was now moving forward at full speed.

198
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:03,000
研发和创新遍及各处
Research and innovation was everywhere.

199
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:08,070
设计师和工程师提出的概念超前好几年
Designers and engineers came up with concepts that were years in advance of their time.

200
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:15,540
机身后掠翼风洞试验让德国飞机制造商领先盟军
Wind tunnel tests into swept wings and fuselage configurations enable the German plane makers to be way ahead of the allies.

201
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:26,760
*我们参考估测以及计算、对比得出的结果，
直到有了那种感觉：
It was a mixture of calculations and calculate this and that and comparisons and was carrying out tells us until you got the feelings,

202
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:28,140
就是这个！
this was it,

203
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:32,580
然后他重构、测试、度量，乐在其中
And then he rebuilt it and tried it and measured it, and it was fun.

204
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,410
1942年7月18日
on July the 18th 1942,

205
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,720
*这是属于Me-262的一天 
the Me-262 made its day.

206
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,820
*首飞是有目的性的
At the first flight of the day was not without its *purpose.

207
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:56,370
我们陷入了困境：机尾无法抬升
We ran into difficulties when the plane's tail would not lift up,

208
00:16:56,371 --> 00:17:02,580
因此我们测试发现，如果飞行员在高速时缓慢减速
So we ran tests and discovered that if the pilot brakes gently at speed,

209
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,720
机尾就可以抬升了
then the tail would lift up. 

210
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,450
措施有效。当飞机时速达到120英里时
It worked. when the aircraft reached 120 miles per hour.

211
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:15,450
当飞行员轻触刹车，机头下降
The pilots touched the brakes, the nose dropped,

212
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,830
机尾抬升
the tale came up

213
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,620
Me-262成功升空
and the Me-262, took to the air.

214
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,650
Me-262在首飞测试中展示的性能相当惊人
The performance of the Me-262 with its test flight was incredible.

215
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:37,170
第二次飞行时，爬升到了11500英尺，最后时速为450英里
On its second fly to climb to 11,500 feet and
reached the speed of 450 miles per hour.

216
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:40,530
其他盟军飞机做得到吗？
already, it was faster than any allied planes in existence.

217
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,590
很快，德国飞行员就能在别人梦想的时速下飞行
Soon, German pilots would be flying at speeds that others could only have dreamt up.

218
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,640
但Me-262会成为元首的梦想战机吗？
But would the Me-262 be the answer to Hitler's dreams?

219
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,590
现在Me-262的喷气引擎可以让它的时速超过550英里(885km/h)
The Me-262's jet engines could now thrust it at speeds of over 550 miles  per hour.

220
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,020
可以轻易超过一切对手
It could simply outfly anything in the sky.

221
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,770
配备4门30mm口径机炮
Armed with four thirty millimeter cannons,

222
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:11,610
每一门都可以发射超过80发高爆弹
each was capable of delivering over eighty explosive shells into the enemy.

223
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,070
未来计划包括挂载24发空对空火箭弹
Future plans were also to include 24 wings slung air to air rockets.

224
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,190
代号“燕子”
Nicknamed the Swallow,

225
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,260
这一杰作预示着空战新纪元的黎明
This awesome machine heralded the dawning of a new age of battle .

226
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:31,350
对纳粹空军来说，它被寄予厚望
And for Hitler's Luftwaffe ,it was hoped that when it finally met the allied forces, it's hell would be unleashed.

227
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:45,060
这次成功的测试飞行最终说服了空军的将军们
The successful test flight of the German Me-262 had at last proved to the Luftwaffe generals.

228
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:48,240
这就是可以赢得战争的机器
This was the fighting machine that could win the war,

229
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:53,730
但在成为满足纳粹目标的无敌机器之前，仍有很多研发工作要做
but a lot of development work was still needed before it could become the all-conquering answer to Nazi dreams.

230
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,680
在美国，两位科学家夜以继日地工作。
In America, two scientists were working around the clock.

231
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:05,610
通用电气公司已经成功完成喷气引擎的试验
*Gec had successfully completed trials with their jet engines.

232
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,930
贝尔航空公司签订了一架实验机合同
The Bell Aircraft Corporation was contracted to supply an experimental plane to test.

233
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,210
1942年10月1日，在绝密护送下
On October the 1st 1942 amidst great secrecy,

234
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:22,530
美国第一架喷气实验机 XP-59a
America's first jet aircraft called the XP-59a,

235
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,930
在加利福尼亚莫洛克干湖起飞
was flown at Muroc Dry lake in California.

236
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,130
测试结果却令人失望
But the tests were disappointed.

237
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:33,600
飞机只能达到390英里的最大时速
The aircraft could only manage a maximum speed of 390 miles per hour.

238
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:37,290
这一速度比很多德国和盟军的活塞动力飞机还慢
This speed was below many of the German and allied piston powered planes.

239
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:46,200
但是XP-59a仍然是美国未来喷气机工业的重要基础
But the XP-59a, did play an important part in the race and was to be the foundation of America's future jet aircraft industry.

240
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:57,570
美国喷气研发进程缓慢，因为美国军方的普遍观点是用现有的武器赢得战争
The American Turbojet Development program proceeded a slow pace because the overall objective of the American military was to win the war with the weapons at hand.

241
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,620
The construction in large numbers of conventional piston engined aircraft,

242
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:06,300
例如P-51野马和B-17
such as the North American P-51 Mustang and the Boeing B-17.

243
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:08,760
这些看起来才是能赢得战争的武器
Those were seen as the weapons it would win the war,

244
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:13,140
因此审视喷气技术，这被看做是一项长期工程
So, looking at jet technology, it was seen as a long term development.

245
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,020
然而在德国，Me-262在紧张的评估过程中被提升到最高优先级
Yet in Germany, the Me-262 was given top priority as it went through a period of intense evaluation.

246
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,650
1943年五月
In May 1943,

247
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:31,320
帝国空军最著名的飞行员加兰德第一次驾驶Me-262
the Luftwaffe's most famous *areas Adolf Galland flew the Me-262 for the first time.

248
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,820
驾驶过后，他说：这不是一小步，而是一个飞跃
After the flight, he was a *main saying This is not a step forward. This is a leap.

249
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,040
他描述这次的飞行为：“像被天使推动一样”
He also described the flight as like being pushed by angels.

250
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,650
元首也对飞机的性能愈发激动
Hitler too was becoming more and more excited about the plane's performance.

251
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,070
面对即将到来的盟军轰炸机的日常攻击
with his right now coming under daily attacks from allied bombers,

252
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:59,760
他下令全力投产Me-262
he ordered the Me-262 to be put into full scale production,

253
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,360
不仅作为战斗机，还要有轰炸机的型号
not only as a fighter, but also was a bomber.

254
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,670
元首认为只要有一千架喷气轰炸机
He felt that if he had one thousand jet bombers,

255
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:09,300
纳粹就可以阻止，至少也能延缓盟军的攻势
they could halt or at least delay the expected Allied invasion.

256
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:16,170
梅塞施密特被元首问到是否可以在Me-262上装炸弹
Messerschmitt had been asked if you could drop bombs with it.

257
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:18,450
梅塞施密特回答到：当然可以用它来投弹
Of course you could drop bombs on it.

258
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,160
但这不是最初的设计目的
But that was not what it had been built for .

259
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,140
两枚炸弹仅仅被挂载在翼下，因为我们被元首要求这么做
And two bombs were only fitted underneath because we'd been ordered to do so.

260
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,340
部分意见被采纳，其他则完全不理会
Some blame *take for it and others tried to put the blame elsewhere.

261
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,640
完全是乱来
It was all nonsense

262
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:41,130
战斗机还是轰炸机的纠结将会是灾难性的错误
The confusion and trying to build freighter versions and modify the plan to be a bomber would be a disastrous mistake.

263
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,340
1944年6月6日，盟军成功在诺曼底登陆
On June the 6th 1944 the Allies successfully landed on the beaches of France.

264
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,050
欧洲攻势开始
The invasion of Europe had begun.

265
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,460
德国人想赶走盟军，结果只是徒劳
Vainly the Germans tried to throw the invaders back,

266
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:05,460
随着盟军夺取取制空权，而没有可用的Me-262
but with the allies having complete air superiority and with no operational Me-262 is available,

267
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:07,200
德国人被迫撤退
The Germans were forced to retreat.

268
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:16,440
On hearing this, it is reported that Hitler flew into a rage and two days after D-day,

269
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:20,280
he announced a few rabbits and order of the leader,

270
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:23,760
which demanded the Emmy to six to be made only as a bomber.

271
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,130
Despite Hitler's orders,

272
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:33,450
limited numbers of the fighter version did come off the production line.

273
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,610
They were quickly rushed to the training schools.

274
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,060
Destined to be flown by the elite.

275
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:43,920
It was here that the cream of the German Luftwaffe and saw the Emmy to six to for the first time.

276
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,670
Training for professionals,

277
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:50,010
We were surprised when we first saw it standing there.

278
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,080
The gun that was really not credible,

279
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,470
the training of these pilots was given top priority,

280
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:00,360
but with the tide of war running against them,

281
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,640
there was little time for classroom tactics.

282
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,360
You are full of the training.

283
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:09,660
It was a very simple via tag for half days of lessons.

284
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,570
Then you had to do your first flight on your own because the machines were single seasons.

285
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,190
One day we had to give our work that we would not damage the machines.

286
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:28,770
otherwise we would be punished or immediately sent back to the units we can try it out for their own economies.

287
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,780
With that warning,

288
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:34,110
uppermost in their minds even for these experienced pilots,

289
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:35,970
the first flights were always known.

290
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,480
Again,

291
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:43,800
if a sergeant who was on the wing explained to me the interior of the plain facts,

292
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,180
especially what to look out for.

293
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,460
For example,

294
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:51,960
the guests for the engine was only stepped on very slowly in each day,

295
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,400
otherwise the engine would stall.

296
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,460
The turbine engine had to get used to the speed very slowly,

297
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:00,780
so one had to be very careful.

298
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,480
Joshua of Persons once in the air,

299
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:13,350
the experience of flying and Emmy to six to surpassed all their expectations from Pfleger Yeltsin.

300
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,690
here for any pilot passionate about flying.

301
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:18,090
It was a most extraordinary experience,

302
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:22,050
especially so because the roaring engine was not in front of your news.

303
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:23,280
All the noise was behind.

304
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:23,430
You.

305
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,230
A wonderful thing.

306
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,310
Our solution.

307
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,010
The speed was really enormous.

308
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,580
And the flying characteristics were so advantageous.

309
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,420
You actually had a sense of confidence in that machine.

310
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,560
Although the German pilots would praise the takeoff and speed at the plane,

311
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:49,020
it was the landing that gave them problems.

312
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:55,860
I don't have no one to nine Plain one could just switch off the engine and drift done slowly.

313
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,260
But in this plane it wasn't possible at all.

314
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,800
I was traveling at a speed of four hundred and five hundred miles per hour and couldn't reduce it.

315
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,410
The plane just wouldn't descend.

316
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:16,350
I looked at the altitude meter and had to fly in circles until I finally reached an altitude of three thousand feet then asked for permission to land,

317
00:25:16,351 --> 00:25:19,590
I lowered the landing gear and slowly approached the runway.

318
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,180
Finally,

319
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:26,790
I was able to learn to see if anyone was greatly relieved and contrast to my usual take off in London.

320
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:33,090
It was completely soaked with sweat and the seeking new flu shots and learn a lot as its creatures.

321
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,160
Initially,

322
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:38,460
it was planned that only fighter aces would fly the plane,

323
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:42,390
but four years of war had taken its toll on the left above his finest,

324
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:43,950
so regular planets,

325
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:48,090
some with as little as ten hours' flying experience were drafted in.

326
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:50,040
But for inexperienced pilots,

327
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,370
the Emmy to six to was not an easy plan to fly,

328
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:56,910
and over two hundred pilots were killed in training alone.

329
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:59,160
That's a really funny is,

330
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:00,120
of course,

331
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:03,810
the first ones to whom I count myself as well.

332
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:04,590
We were the best.

333
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:13,470
But those who followed us we're often at the beginning of their pilot training and didn't cope with the machine that's going to put.

334
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,100
those people in.

335
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:15,810
The jet was totally irresponsible.

336
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,720
We had young,

337
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:19,560
glossy standard.

338
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:22,920
By mid nine thousand,

339
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,030
nine hundred and ninety four,

340
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:26,580
those pilots that had survived the training was sent.

341
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:33,900
A newly formed squadrons ground crews to wear hastily recruited to service and maintain these new wonder weapon.

342
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,850
We have found,

343
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:40,470
generally speaking,

344
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:46,410
my experience was that the ground crew tried very hard to ensure that the planes were always ready for takeoff.

345
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:55,980
I did not get to know them well enough because I've always had to be ready for action and was waiting for an emergency takeoff.

346
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,110
That's how long standards.

347
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:01,380
sometimes that does not happen at all.

348
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,470
Hence the saying half of one's life.

349
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:05,250
It's on weights,

350
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,110
invasion of dementia games.

351
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,370
Oh,

352
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:11,610
yeah.

353
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:16,740
Stem?

354
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,810
Yet the waiting was short lived,

355
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:24,480
with thousands of bombers now pounding Germany.

356
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:25,320
Every available.

357
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:26,790
Pilots was thrown into action.

358
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,310
Just go.

359
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,210
On July,

360
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:51,780
two thousand and nine thousand,

361
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:52,020
one thousand,

362
00:27:52,021 --> 00:28:01,320
nine hundred and ninety nine an Emmy to six to became the first jet airplane to be used in combat when it shot down a British photo reconnaissance mosquito flying over Munich.

363
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:09,870
It now appeared that the race for the jet fighter had been won and with it the prize of victory in the skies,

364
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:12,270
which was now within the liftoff as grubs.

365
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,060
During the late summer of one thousand,

366
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:24,960
nine hundred and ninety nine more and more German lived for pilots were taking their new Emmy to six to jet fighters into battle.

367
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:30,570
It seemed as though finally they now had a weapon that could beat the Allied bombers and their high speed escort.

368
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,850
This British spying in March there were two groups of four mustangs in close formation,

369
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:42,750
and they were so incredibly confident they hadn't seen me,

370
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,300
and that was a mistake.

371
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:46,530
I'm sharing the young,

372
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:47,400
some guys Yankees,

373
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,360
are.

374
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:51,060
I actually felt sorry for the guys is they hadn't noticed me?

375
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,100
I came from deep,

376
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:53,370
low,

377
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:57,570
right and flew in there we had four thirty millimeter guns the mark,

378
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,890
one of eight.

379
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,870
there was an incredible fire,

380
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,420
because the whole thing presented itself to me.

381
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,280
I was a long outstretched point.

382
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:06,330
You couldn't actually miss.

383
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,000
And then two fighters dropped down.

384
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,250
With one I saw a parachute travel with the other one.

385
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:14,700
I didn't.

386
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,640
That was such a case.

387
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,110
By late one thousand,

388
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:27,420
nine hundred and ninety four to six tubes were attacking the Allied bombers with devastating effect,

389
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:31,080
Allied fighter and bomber crews were unsure how to deal with them.

390
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:35,610
Their speed and firepower with just two is so close to the ground.

391
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:37,020
We couldn't get a shot.

392
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,870
And then he goes.

393
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,500
My fellows and I just said the graphical we just saw a real pilot.

394
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:03,750
We were jumped by nearly two hundred and sixty two and only got a very short glimpse of him because he made an attack from about three o'clock and he came down through the group.

395
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,240
Went by so fast,

396
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:07,410
we can only see him.

397
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,600
It was really shocked because it was like nothing that we'd seen before.

398
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,020
The German pilots had not felt such supremacy in the air since the early days of the war.

399
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:25,560
They felt sure that this incredible plane would turn the tide dial floaters and decent alarm.

400
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:31,200
I flew to the area around Dresden and went down to sixteen thousand feet.

401
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:35,370
I started to fighter planes as they were above me,

402
00:30:35,371 --> 00:30:40,590
I increased my altitude and I took one of the fighter planes in my sights.

403
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:41,160
In those days,

404
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:41,610
the machine,

405
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:43,860
guns and cannons were automatically switched on.

406
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,680
I had full cannons and I gave off a burst of fire damage,

407
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,210
and before I knew it,

408
00:30:51,211 --> 00:30:55,020
the pilot parachuted out of his plane where I had hit him.

409
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:55,740
I did not know.

410
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,710
It was all very new,

411
00:30:58,711 --> 00:30:59,670
much too fast.

412
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:01,530
Jim was watching.

413
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:02,430
It often has a silence,

414
00:31:02,431 --> 00:31:02,670
guns,

415
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:03,720
volume features,

416
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,630
and then suddenly I saw the second fighter plane in front of me.

417
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,300
And I fired at it,

418
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,050
and it went down,

419
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,990
surrounded by smoke that looked like a flag.

420
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:13,980
Starting its army.

421
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,190
But it was the bombers that were the Emmy to six two's real prey.

422
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,050
Lift of Autopilot,

423
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:27,330
Alfred Arms was on a routine patrol when he came across a be seventeen on its thirteen commission.

424
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,400
Tito shook the system.

425
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:35,820
Everyone quickly chose a plane without having any great discussions about whether they were going to take this or the other player poses.

426
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:36,270
Instead,

427
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,510
you would say the best position for me is the one in the middle.

428
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:40,260
That's not a role.

429
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:42,090
There were enough planes in the sky,

430
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:43,470
which made it easy to pick one image.

431
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,690
The rear gather in that particular be seventeen was nineteen year old,

432
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:50,130
Craig Bennett.

433
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,140
He came so fast.

434
00:31:52,141 --> 00:31:56,640
all you had time was just pull the triggers and let the guns fire.

435
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,160
Aim the Ms Bastion,

436
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:00,090
cut out this night.

437
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,920
I was aiming at a fortress when suddenly ahead of me,

438
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:14,850
there was a large wall of fire into which the captain of my squadron and others disappeared in alchemy,

439
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:15,510
fresh ones.

440
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,220
The first plane was the leader and he hit our plane.

441
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,390
The plane just blew up.

442
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,210
The whole brain exploded his plane and ours.

443
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,530
Uber defy a bicycle autumn.

444
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:34,920
I was able to fly over the wall of fame.

445
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:41,220
It turned out that the fortress had exploded and taken to adjacent flames with AMC hit safely.

446
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:43,530
That's how big the explosion was.

447
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,420
So if you think about the explosion footmen.

448
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,370
And the tail broke off.

449
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,490
and started falling.

450
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,550
And the rest of the plane was gone.

451
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,430
I was only one.

452
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:00,450
they got out of my eye.

453
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,210
Craig Bennett was to spend.

454
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:04,620
The rest of the war is a peer,

455
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:05,040
W.

456
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,640
Yet it was not all a one sided fight.

457
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:14,280
Once they got over the shock of these new wonder weapons,

458
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:18,600
the Allied pilots slowly began to learn how to deal with the German gentlemen.

459
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:26,220
The first problem was how to overcome the huge speed disadvantage the pilot's found that when they put the Mustang into a steep dive,

460
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,770
their speed was the same as the Emmy to six too.

461
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,760
So I just bent the throttle as far as it goes forward,

462
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,350
without going through the stop.

463
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,090
And?

464
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,330
Slowly,

465
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:39,960
very,

466
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:44,610
very slowly start gain a little on the guy because he was making a little term.

467
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:45,780
And each time you turn a little bit,

468
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:46,710
I get a little closer.

469
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,190
When I finally got up raids,

470
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:52,440
this guy was inexperienced.

471
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:53,760
Sure,

472
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:56,700
as when he saw the first tracers,

473
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,210
either no.

474
00:33:57,211 --> 00:33:59,250
by hammer hit his airplane,

475
00:33:59,251 --> 00:34:00,660
he made a turn.

476
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:02,700
If you to put his nose down,

477
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:03,300
how do we run?

478
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:04,080
We probably know God.

479
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,020
A movie where we've gotten range.

480
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:16,200
The Allied pilots also found that the Emmy to six to did not respond US quake in a turn as propeller planes.

481
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,870
This would have deadly consequences.

482
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:29,040
I was on the inside of his circle and I was able to get a bead on him and shoot in front of him,

483
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,960
so he would fly into the bullets.

484
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,840
But it was on takeoff and landing at the Emmy to six too,

485
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:41,070
with at its most vulnerable.

486
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,600
Allied pilots lay in wait around the airfields.

487
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,940
Hundreds of two six two pilots were to dine.

488
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:49,380
In this way.

489
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:55,260
the Americana see the Americans change their tactics to concentrate on all their fields,

490
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,390
where jet fighter units with station I live.

491
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,760
This way they were able to hit us when we were most vulnerable.

492
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:06,540
We were like during startup and landing for boats.

493
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,430
Postage tend to get rid of this.

494
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:10,890
where their start during takeoff.

495
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,300
We did not have enough speed.

496
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,730
And when landing,

497
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:16,830
we had to reduce it.

498
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,150
That was the problem.

499
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:19,380
this we're just picking.

500
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,130
With the tide of war turning against them,

501
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:30,270
the Emmy to six to superiority in the skies was over.

502
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:38,190
More and more planes were being shot down and fear was ever present in the remaining pilots mines to get out and come down.

503
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:43,290
The thoughts would only enter your head at a later stage when within the squadron,

504
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:47,100
nearly every third or fourth person had to be replaced every week.

505
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,230
The longer the war lasted,

506
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:54,270
the more this occurred.

507
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:56,640
I believe this led to the end of the wall,

508
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:57,720
some in difficulty.

509
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,870
Furious that the new jet squadrons were being wasted by the German High Command,

510
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:07,320
and under insistence of General Galland and other famous essays,

511
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:12,720
is Hitler reluctantly allowed every twentieth Amy to six to to be built as a fighter.

512
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,600
That's about thirty feet and having a bastion,

513
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,490
it was a completely wrong thing to do.

514
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,750
And some of the bombers were used as night fighters.

515
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,920
they had totally misjudge.

516
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:27,450
The situation can only assume that they were following their own delusion.

517
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:31,500
Feedback about the infamous fear of Bethel.

518
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:35,220
The order of the leader was at last rescinded in late one thousand,

519
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:36,780
nine hundred and ninety four.

520
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:41,550
Hitler finally ordered that all Emmy to six tubes should now be built as fighters.

521
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,750
With the allies marching into Germany,

522
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:46,710
was it to little?

523
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,800
By early one thousand,

524
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:56,910
nine hundred and ninety five,

525
00:36:56,911 --> 00:37:00,030
and with nearly all her factories destroyed by the Allies,

526
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:05,190
Germany was finding it almost impossible to produce the jet fighters so desperately needed.

527
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:07,110
So a novel solution was brought about.

528
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,540
If I feel new.

529
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,510
The bombing did slow everything down.

530
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,740
But if we had enough material,

531
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:19,500
we could have manufactured the required numbers.

532
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:20,520
Let's say forty,

533
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,570
three or forty four.

534
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,960
The rain fiancee fiance Betsy,

535
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:25,590
in the end,

536
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:28,860
we got used to it more went into the woods,

537
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:31,050
where we put up large shelters.

538
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:37,080
Camouflage tennis manufactured throughout Germany.

539
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:42,090
Sections of the Emmy to six to were then delivered under cover of darkness by truck,

540
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:42,870
horse and cart,

541
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:46,710
and even bicycles to be fully assembled in forests.

542
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,050
Over eight hundred were to be built in this way.

543
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,240
But as more and more Emmy to six tubes were being destroyed by allied fighters,

544
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,970
so too with the cream of the German live together.

545
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,530
One day a plane came crashing down above me and my plane caught fire.

546
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,460
I had to bail out.

547
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,550
That's how I had to land with my parachute.

548
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,130
And that was the end of the war.

549
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:14,610
For me.

550
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,560
If I am a Canadian,

551
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:23,400
there was suddenly a big bang for a couple of brief moments.

552
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,100
I did not look back as I would usually do.

553
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,990
I was looking in the sky to see what had happened.

554
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,560
There was a flash some way.

555
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh,

556
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:33,210
then,

557
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:34,020
I saw the engine.

558
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,900
what was catching fire than the ice At that stage,

559
00:38:36,901 --> 00:38:39,690
I was about four thousand feet above the layer of clouds.

560
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,850
Upon seeing the fire,

561
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:44,550
I immediately dived into the clouds,

562
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:48,630
have changed course and turned left in order to get out of the line of fire.

563
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:51,660
so far nothing spake of him full in shape.

564
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,430
I wanted to jump up with a parachute.

565
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,580
Then I remembered that someone had once told me that if you are too frightened to jump off,

566
00:38:59,581 --> 00:39:01,620
then push the joystick to the side,

567
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:06,810
and it will stand on it with your foot stage and push yourself up.

568
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,190
That's what I did establish the matter.

569
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,350
Towards the end of the war,

570
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:23,310
there simply were not enough trained pilots to fly the jet fighter.

571
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:28,080
Even if there had been the production of the Emmy to six to had ground to a halt,

572
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:32,760
they simply could not build enough jet fighters to stem the tide of the conquering allies.

573
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,340
Germany finally surrendered on May,

574
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:43,620
the seventh one thousand nine hundred and forty five.

575
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:47,820
as cities and factories were totally smashed so too,

576
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:49,560
with her jet aircraft industry.

577
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,430
In the following months,

578
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:53,820
Britain,

579
00:39:53,821 --> 00:40:01,260
America and Russia squabbled over the carcasses of the wonder jets that were scattered throughout Germany and picking through the bones,

580
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:04,140
they began to build their own jet aircraft industries.

581
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,330
In an operation called operation Lusty.

582
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:10,470
Under the command of kernel,

583
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:11,340
Watson,

584
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:14,340
the Americans gathered all the German planes they could find.

585
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,240
They were flown to Cherbourg in France and then shipped to America for revaluation.

586
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:33,450
Watson's wizards were a group of American pilots tasked with capturing flying German aircraft to the French coast and bringing them back to the United States for testing and evaluation,

587
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:37,140
a commitment to getting this new technology back to the United States,

588
00:40:37,141 --> 00:40:39,990
and they were actually racing against the British and the Soviets.

589
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:45,060
To do this would ensure that America would have an aeronautical superiority.

590
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:47,520
In the postwar period,

591
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:55,020
the Americans began an extensive testing program of the MIT to six tubes by analyzing the jet turbines and wind design.

592
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:56,610
At this German fighter,

593
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:59,190
they were able to produce their own design,

594
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:00,750
which was to become the fabulous.

595
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:02,010
At eighty six saver.

596
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,980
It's not until the German jet technology that's brought over through operation,

597
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:10,980
lusty and other programs that aircraft,

598
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:21,210
like North American and eighty six with its webbed Wayne especially reflect the German technology and the way to design a proper and efficient jet airplane.

599
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,110
The Russians also dealt into the Emmy to six to the secrets and,

600
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:32,670
with the help of British jet's technology would later build then make fifty.

601
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,290
Really,

602
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:39,630
the boost for the Russian engineer in history was what they captured from the Germans at the end of the Second World War.

603
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:40,950
The main thing,

604
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:41,160
though,

605
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:42,360
really for the Russian aircraft.

606
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:52,200
and she was when we get then our latest injured and that allowed to make fifteen to go from being an average aircraft with good design to a world beater.

607
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,320
Along with the enemy to six years moved to America when designer Hans von Hohenheim,

608
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:02,400
he was to become the chief scientist of error Propulsion for the United States' efforts.

609
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,060
Frank would eventually moved to America,

610
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:10,200
where he became a consultant on several aviation projects.

611
00:42:10,201 --> 00:42:11,280
Vilhelm meshes meets.

612
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:17,490
The father of the Emmy to six two remained in Germany and helps in rebuilding their shattered aircraft industry.

613
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:24,180
Hundreds of allied aircraft were to fall victim to the Emmy to six too.

614
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:26,190
but at a terrible price,

615
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:30,660
hardly any of the four thousand eight hundred Emmy to six tubes that were built survived the war.

616
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:38,460
Yet many people still believe that if the Emmy to six to had entered service earlier,

617
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:40,590
it couldn't save Germany from defeat.

618
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:49,470
The future Buddha there has been a lot of speculation and perhaps if they could have introduced the whole program half a year earlier.

619
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,960
But if you are truthfully,

620
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:58,410
would it have decided to walk or tricks only the gods know reason isn't a good?

621
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:01,890
Germany had won the race to get a jet fighter into the air.

622
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:04,080
it outclassed all its rivals,

623
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,690
and in its short operational life of seven months,

624
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:11,400
the Emmy to six to had pushed forward the frontiers of air combat to new heights.

625
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,520
This was best at the time it was the best fighter plane in the world.

626
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,370
And as an aircraft.

627
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,960
It was an exceptional solution exceptional illusion.

628
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,920
We were surprised that the others could not do that,

629
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:31,260
and it's like the one that does the mmd chimerical.

630
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:39,510
The Emmy to six to was undoubtedly one of the most famous airplanes in the whole history of German aviation.

631
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:40,350
If not the world.

632
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,090
Born out of a need to be a fearsome destroyed from the day at first flew,

633
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:50,520
it spelled the end of propeller driven aircraft and heralded the dawning of the new jet.
